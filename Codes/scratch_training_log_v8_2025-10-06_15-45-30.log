'summarize Hindi: She may have been shying away from the cameras on Made In Chelsea so far this season, but Lucy Watson proves her career is stronger than ever as she's unveiled as the face of another campaign. The reality TV star is every inch the beach babe as the face of Very.co.uk’s #cantwaitforsummer campaign. The 24-year-old brings the spirit of summer to shoppers, showing off her effortless beach body in the fun and flirty high-summer designs. Scroll down for video . Lucy Watson showcases her toned body as the face of Very.co.uk's #cantwaitforsummer campaign . Lucy, who describes her perfect summer as 'sun, tan and chilling', showcases Ibiza-inspired summer brights and tropical print sun dresses in the shoot. The fitness fanatic, who recently starred in a Made In Chelsea work-out DVD, shows off her toned midriff in cut-out swimwear the brand say is perfect for taking you from the beach to balmy evenings in the bar. The reality TV star, who will be returning to Made In Chelsea in the coming weeks, is every inch the beach babe as she models the colourful clothes in the new shoot . The star, who can be seen showing off swimwear and tiny shorts, describes her perfect summer as 'sun, tan and chilling' Lucy models the Ibiza-inspired summer brights and tropical print sun dresses to perfection . Lucy, who, according to Heat magazine, is tipped to be making an appearance in the E4 show in the next few weeks, has enlisted the help of a personal trainer to keep her looking trim. FEMAIL recently caught up with the fitness aficionado and the man behind her new physique to find out the workout that keeps her in shape. Speaking about how she developed a passion for health and fitness, Lucy, 23, said: 'I'm motivated by people around me and I just got to a point in my life where I needed a change.' Trainer and nutritionist, Ashton Turner, who owns Enhance Nutrition LDN in London and trains Lucy, said: 'Lucy and I met when we worked together on the Made in Chelsea fitness DVD. 'Lucy was one of the cast members who took part in my workout. After the DVD, she wanted to continue with her training and I asked to work with her.' Lucy models cut-out swimwear and kaftans that the brand say are perfect for taking you from the beach to balmy evenings in the bar . Discussing Lucy's physique and fitness before they met, Ashton said: 'Lucy has always had a naturally lean body, which is thanks to her being active growing up and taking part in gymnastics and dance. 'She also leads a fairly healthy lifestyle and pays attention to what she eats. Her fitness levels weren’t terrible but they also weren’t where they could have been, which is probably due to her filming schedule but we all have periods where work or life take a front seat and exercise a back one.' Lucy, who cites her role model as 'amazing' Jessica Alba, said she found working out 'boring' and 'difficult' at first because she had such a busy schedule that she found it hard to get into a routine. Lucy's typical workout incorporates a squat or a deadlift, both of which are great for toning legs and glutes . She said: 'My days are always different and I could never get properly into it. I think it's just wanting those improvements with your body and health in general that motivated me.' Lucy says she likes exercise 'where you don't even realise you're exercising', like tennis or horse riding. But, she says, thanks to Ashton, who is always changing it up and is fun to be around, she never gets bored any more. 'I don't want to emulate anyone else's body,' she admits. 'I just want mine to be toned and lean. I don't want to lose any weight or curves, just tone up what I already have'

'summarize Hindi: Forget Swansea, Stoke City and West Ham, the top seven would be seriously challenged by 'Team Pardew' should this manager have had a full season in charge at one club. That is after Crystal Palace, managed by Alan Pardew, beat Manchester City 2-1 at Selhurst Park on Monday night, the English manager's ninth win in South London since leaving his role at Newcastle at the end of December. His former club have since plummeted in the Premier League while Palace now find themselves threatening the top half, and combining his records at both clubs this season would see 'Team Pardew' sit in eighth place, just five points behind Southampton. Alan Pardew could be a candidate for manager of the year with his record at Newcastle and Crystal Palace . The Premier League table with Team Pardew in - as well as a team complied from pre/post Pardew results . Newcastle fans were calling for Pardew's head for many years, seen as owner Mike Ashley's puppet, and were sitting in 10th place when the 53-year-old returned 'home' to Crystal Palace. The Eagles were in the relegation zone along with Burnley and Leicester City, struggling to pick up points following Neil Warnock's sacking. But while John Carver has picked up just nine points in his 12 games in charge at St James' Park, Pardew's Palace now have 39 points and are comfortably above the drop zone. A team compiled with Newcastle and Crystal Palace's stats pre/post Pardew would be sitting in 19th (albeit with 22 Premier League clubs now technically involved). A top-half finish is now the aim for Pardew and his men, as Toon supporters still fear relegation following a 1-0 derby defeat to Sunderland on Easter Sunday. Pardew celebrates with his Newcastle team and Moussa SIssoko after his goal against QPR in November . Newcastle fans hold a banner calling the removal of Pardew in a Premier League game at Stoke in September . John Carver's Toon side are not safe from relegation yet after a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Sunderland . It all started with a 4-0 win at Dover Athletic in the FA Cup and now Crystal Palace have won four in five, most recently beating the champions. His stock will continue to rise with this table, which would put him just six points adrift of Liverpool in fifth. Pardew has recently insisted he would perform at a top club, better than Monday's counterpart Manuel Pellegrini at least, while he is definitely a contender for Premier League Manager of the Year award. And nobody would have predicted that in 2014. Glenn Murray celebrates after netting the opening goal during Crystal Palace's victory over Manchester City .'
