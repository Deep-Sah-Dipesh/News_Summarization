They also risk isolating his country even further. In a meeting of the security cabinet that lasted 10 hours, ministers approved proposals for the ""takeover of Gaza City"", which is likely to be the first phase for the Israeli military to assume full control of Gaza, as Netanyahu says it is his intention. A statement released by his office did not use the word ""occupation"" but, effectively, that is what the plans mean. It is not clear when the operations, which could take months, will start, as the military will have to call up thousands of reservists, exhausted after serving multiple times, and allow for the forced evacuation of residents from an area where around 800,000 Palestinians live. Many, if not most, have already been repeatedly displaced in this war. The plans will spark fresh condemnation from countries which have expressed anger over the situation in Gaza and urged Israel to end the war, which started as a response to the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has described the decision as ""wrong"" and called on Israel to reconsider it ""immediately"". But international pressure is unlikely to force Netanyahu change his course. There is discontent at home, too. Polls suggest most of the Israeli public favour a deal with Hamas for the release of the 50 hostages, 20 of whom are thought to be alive, and the end of the war. The threat of a full occupation could be part of a strategy to try to force the group into making concessions in stalled ceasefire talks. Israeli leaders say Hamas, for now, is not interested in negotiating as, in their view, the group is feeling emboldened, a view that seems to be shared by the Trump administration which has not expressed opposition to Israel's plans. LIVE: Security cabinet approved Gaza City plan Many here believe that Netanyahu is prolonging the conflict to guarantee the survival of his coalition, which relies on the support of ultranationalist ministers who have threatened to quit the government if the war ends. Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich have also publicly defended what they describe as the voluntary migration of Palestinians from Gaza - which could amount to the forced displacement of civilians, a war crime - and resettling it with Jews. Netanyahu's ideas have faced strong opposition from the army's Chief of Staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir who, according to reports in the Israeli media, had warned the prime minister that a full occupation Gaza was ""tantamount to walking into a trap"" and would endanger the living hostages. Many of the hostages' families share those concerns, and say the only way to guarantee the release of the hostages is through a negotiated deal with Hamas and ending the war. According to the Maariv newspaper, the ""prevailing assessment is that most and possibly all of the living hostages [will] die"" during an expanded offensive, either killed by their captors or accidentally by Israeli soldiers. Watch: MSF doctor Caroline Willeman speaks about worsening situation in Gaza","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is advancing controversial plans for a ""takeover of Gaza City,"" intended as the first phase of Israel assuming full control, effectively an occupation. This initiative has sparked significant division, drawing warnings from Israeli army leadership, strong opposition from hostage families, and threatening to further isolate Israel internationally and domestically.

The proposed operations, which could last months and involve calling up thousands of already exhausted reservists, are expected to cause further widespread displacement in Gaza. Globally, the plan has prompted renewed condemnation, with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer deeming it ""wrong"" and urging immediate reconsideration. Despite this, international pressure is unlikely to sway Netanyahu, especially with no stated opposition from the Trump administration.

Domestically, widespread discontent persists, as polls indicate a majority of Israelis favor a deal with Hamas for hostage release and an end to the conflict. Critics allege Netanyahu is prolonging the war to maintain his coalition, which relies on ultranationalist ministers like Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, who have controversially advocated for the ""voluntary migration""—a concept seen as forced displacement and a potential war crime—of Palestinians from Gaza.

While some speculate the occupation threat aims to force Hamas concessions in stalled ceasefire talks, Israeli leaders believe the group is currently too emboldened to negotiate. However, the military's Chief of Staff has warned against a full Gaza occupation, calling it ""tantamount to walking into a trap."" Hostage families share this grave concern, fearing their loved ones would perish in such an offensive and asserting that a negotiated deal remains the sole path to their release.","इजरायली प्रधानमंत्री बेंजामिन नेतन्याहू ""गाजा शहर पर कब्जे"" की विवादास्पद योजनाओं को आगे बढ़ा रहे हैं। इसका उद्देश्य इजरायल द्वारा पूर्ण नियंत्रण स्थापित करने का पहला चरण है, जो वास्तव में एक कब्ज़ा ही होगा। इस पहल ने गहरा मतभेद पैदा किया है, जिससे इजरायली सेना नेतृत्व से चेतावनी मिली है, बंधक परिवारों का कड़ा विरोध सामने आया है, और यह अंतरराष्ट्रीय और घरेलू स्तर पर इजरायल को और अलग-थलग करने की धमकी दे रहा है।

प्रस्तावित अभियान, जो कई महीनों तक चल सकते हैं और इसमें पहले से ही थके हुए हजारों रिजर्व सैनिकों को बुलाना शामिल होगा, से गाजा में और व्यापक विस्थापन होने की आशंका है। विश्व स्तर पर, इस योजना ने नई निंदा को जन्म दिया है, जिसमें ब्रिटेन के प्रधानमंत्री सर कीर स्टारमर ने इसे ""गलत"" करार दिया है और तत्काल पुनर्विचार का आग्रह किया है। इसके बावजूद, अंतरराष्ट्रीय दबाव से नेतन्याहू के रुख में बदलाव आने की संभावना कम है, खासकर तब जब ट्रम्प प्रशासन की ओर से कोई व्यक्त विरोध नहीं है।

घरेलू स्तर पर, व्यापक असंतोष बना हुआ है, क्योंकि सर्वेक्षणों से पता चलता है कि अधिकांश इजरायली बंधकों की रिहाई और संघर्ष को समाप्त करने के लिए हमास के साथ एक समझौते के पक्ष में हैं। आलोचकों का आरोप है कि नेतन्याहू अपने गठबंधन को बनाए रखने के लिए युद्ध को लंबा खींच रहे हैं, जो इटामार बेन-गविर और बेज़लेल स्मोट्रिच जैसे अति-राष्ट्रवादी मंत्रियों पर निर्भर करता है। इन मंत्रियों ने विवादास्पद रूप से गाजा से फिलिस्तीनियों के ""स्वैच्छिक प्रवासन"" की वकालत की है—एक ऐसी अवधारणा जिसे जबरन विस्थापन और संभावित युद्ध अपराध के रूप में देखा जाता है।

जबकि कुछ लोग यह अनुमान लगाते हैं कि कब्जे की धमकी का उद्देश्य ठप पड़ी संघर्ष विराम वार्ता में हमास को रियायतें देने के लिए मजबूर करना है, इजरायली नेताओं का मानना है कि यह समूह वर्तमान में बातचीत करने के लिए बहुत साहसी हो चुका है। हालांकि, सेना प्रमुख ने गाजा पर पूर्ण कब्जे के खिलाफ चेतावनी दी है, इसे ""जाल में फंसने के बराबर"" बताया है। बंधक परिवार भी इस गंभीर चिंता को साझा करते हैं, उन्हें डर है कि ऐसे हमले में उनके प्रियजन मारे जाएंगे और वे इस बात पर जोर दे रहे हैं कि उनकी रिहाई का एकमात्र रास्ता एक बातचीत से हुआ समझौता ही है।",en,[],,The Israeli PM's proposals have provoked condemnation from the UK and the UN,[''],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Australian woman was last month found guilty of murdering three relatives - and attempting to kill another - with a toxic mushroom-laced beef Wellington. The 50-year-old was originally charged with three counts of attempted murder against her estranged husband Simon Patterson, but these charges were dropped without explanation on the eve of her trial. The details of the allegations, which Patterson denied, were suppressed to protect the proceedings, but can now be made public for the first time. Three people died in hospital in the days after the lunch on 29 July 2023: Patterson's former in-laws, Don Patterson, 70, and Gail Patterson, 70, as well as Gail's sister, Heather Wilkinson, 66. Local pastor Ian Wilkinson – Heather's husband – recovered after weeks of treatment in hospital. In lengthy pre-trial hearings last year, Mr Patterson had detailed what he suspected was a years-long campaign to kill him with tainted food - including one episode which had left him so ill he spent weeks in a coma and his family was twice told to say their goodbyes. Camping trips and packed lunches In a quiet moment during the early days of Patterson's trial, her estranged husband choked up as he explained his sorrow to a near empty courtroom. Mr Patterson's parents and his aunt had been killed, and his uncle almost died too, after eating the toxic meal prepared by his wife. He had narrowly avoided the same fate, pulling out of the lunch gathering the day before. ""I have a lot to grieve,"" he said to the judge, sitting in the witness box as the jury prepared to return from a break. ""The legal process has been very difficult... especially the way it's progressed in terms of the charges relating to me and my evidence about that - or non-evidence now, I guess."" ""I'm sitting here, half thinking about the things I'm not allowed to talk about and… I don't actually understand why. It seems bizarre to me, but it is what it is."" What he wasn't allowed to talk about – the elephant in the room throughout the trial – was his claim that Patterson had been trying to poison him long before the fatal lunch that destroyed his family on 29 July 2023. EPA Charges relating to Simon Patterson were dropped on the eve of the trial Mr Patterson gave evidence during pre-trial hearings, which are a standard part of the court process and allow judges to determine what evidence is admissible - or allowed to be presented to a jury. As the charges relating to Mr Patterson were dropped, his evidence on the matter was excluded from the raft of information presented at the nine-week trial this year. But he had explained that, as far as he knows, it all began with a Tupperware container of Bolognese penne in November 2021. Mr Patterson and his wife had separated in 2015 – though they still aren't divorced – and he thought they remained on amicable terms. Under questioning from Patterson's lawyer, Mr Patterson confirmed he had noticed ""nothing untoward"" in their relationship at that point: ""If by 'nothing untoward', you mean anything that would make me think she would try and kill me, correct."" But after eating that meal, he began suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea, and spent a night in hospital. ""I had the idea I got sick from Erin's food. I did not give it too much thought,"" he said in his police statement, according to The Age newspaper. Reuters Patterson claimed the fatal meal in 2023 was a tragic accident Months later, in May 2022, he fell ill again after eating a chicken korma curry prepared by Patterson on a camping trip in the rugged mountains and alpine scruff of Victoria's High Country region. ""While Erin was preparing food I was getting the fire going so I didn't watch her prepare it,"" he told the court. Within days, he was in a coma in a Melbourne hospital, and a large part of his bowel was surgically removed in a bid to save his life. ""My family were asked to come and say goodbye to me twice, as I was not expected to live,"" he said in a 2022 Facebook post, reported by The South Gippsland Sentinel Times two years ago. In September 2022, while visiting a stunning, isolated stretch of Victorian coastline, he would become desperately unwell again after eating a vegetable wrap. At first, he felt nausea and diarrhoea coming on, the court heard, before his symptoms escalated. He started slurring his speech, gradually lost control of his muscles, and began ""fitting"". ""By the end of the journey [to hospital], all I could move was my neck, my tongue and lips,"" he told the court. The food diary and chapel meeting A family friend who was a doctor, Christopher Ford, suggested Mr Patterson start a food diary so they could try to figure out what was making him so sick. ""I couldn't understand why these things kept on happening to him in such a way that he had essentially three near-death experiences,"" Dr Ford told the court. Mr Patterson returned to see him in February 2023, five months before the fatal lunch, revealing he'd come to believe his estranged wife was responsible. He told Dr Ford about a batch of cookies supposedly baked by his daughter, which he feared were treats tainted – possibly with antifreeze chemicals - by his wife, who had called repeatedly to check whether he had eaten any. The court would hear investigators never figured out what Patterson had allegedly been feeding him, though they suspected rat poison may have been used on at least one occasion, and had found a file on Patterson's computer with information about the toxin. After this discovery, Mr Patterson changed his medical power of attorney, removing his wife, and quietly told a handful of family members of his fears. Erin Patterson separated from her husband Simon in 2015 The court heard that his father Don Patterson responded diplomatically, but his sister Anna Terrington told the pre-trial hearings she had believed her brother, and was anxious when she learned about the lunch Patterson had planned. Ms Terrington called her parents the night before to warn them. ""Dad said, 'No, we'll be ok',"" she said. Five days later, she gathered in a Melbourne hospital chapel alongside her brother and other worried relatives. Down the hall, deteriorating in their beds, were Don and Gail Patterson and Heather and Ian Wilkinson. Ruth Dubois, the Wilkinsons' daughter, told the pre-trial hearings Simon Patterson had assembled the group to tell them he suspected his previous grave illnesses were the work of his wife. ""[He said] he had stopped eating food than Erin had prepared, because he suspected Erin had been messing with it,"" she said. ""He was really sorry that he hadn't told our family before this… but he thought he was the only person she was targeting, and that they'd be safe."" Bizarre evidence Watch: Australia’s mushroom murder case... in under two minutes It was also revealed that Patterson had visited a local tip the afternoon of the lunch at her house, though it is unknown what, if anything, she disposed of there. The jury heard that she had travelled to the same dump days after the lunch to get rid of a food dehydrator used to prepare the meal, but the judge ruled they couldn't be told about the first visit. Other bizarre evidence which was ultimately left out of the trial included a 2020 post to a poisons help forum on Facebook, in which Patterson claimed her cat had eaten some mushrooms under a tree and had vomited, alongside pictures of fungi. Patterson had never owned a cat, prosecutors said, arguing the post was evidence of a long-standing interest in the poisonous properties of mushrooms. On Friday, Justice Christopher Beale set down a sentencing hearing for 25 August, where those connected to the case will have the opportunity to give victim impact statements.","Convicted triple-murderer Erin Patterson, found guilty of killing three relatives and attempting to kill another with a toxic mushroom-laced beef Wellington, is now revealed to have allegedly attempted to poison her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, multiple times before the fatal lunch. Although charges related to Simon Patterson's attempted murder were dropped prior to her trial, details of his pre-trial testimony, alleging a years-long campaign of poisoning against him, are now public.

Simon Patterson described falling severely ill after eating bolognese penne (November 2021), chicken korma curry (May 2022, leading to a coma and partial bowel removal), and a vegetable wrap (September 2022, causing near-paralysis). He eventually suspected his wife, changed his medical power of attorney, and privately warned family members.

The fatal lunch on July 29, 2023, killed his parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail's sister, Heather Wilkinson, while Heather's husband, Ian Wilkinson, survived. Simon himself narrowly avoided the meal after pulling out the day before. He later told relatives in the hospital that he believed Erin had targeted him previously and expressed regret for not warning them sooner, believing they would be safe.

Other revelations include Patterson's visits to a local tip after the fatal meal to dispose of a food dehydrator and a peculiar Facebook post about a ""cat"" consuming mushrooms (despite her not owning a cat), which prosecutors cited as evidence of her interest in toxins. Erin Patterson's sentencing hearing is scheduled for August 25.","**एरीन पैटर्सन, जिसे तीन रिश्तेदारों की हत्या करने और एक अन्य को जहरीले मशरूम मिले बीफ वेलिंगटन से मारने की कोशिश करने का दोषी पाया गया है, के बारे में अब खुलासा हुआ है कि उसने जानलेवा दोपहर के भोजन से पहले कथित तौर पर अपने अलग रह रहे पति, साइमन पैटर्सन, को कई बार ज़हर देने की कोशिश की थी। हालांकि, साइमन पैटर्सन की हत्या के प्रयास से संबंधित आरोप उसके मुकदमे से पहले हटा दिए गए थे, फिर भी उसकी सुनवाई-पूर्व गवाही का विवरण, जिसमें उस पर सालों तक ज़हर देने का अभियान चलाने का आरोप लगाया गया था, अब सार्वजनिक हो गया है।**

अन्य खुलासों में जानलेवा भोजन के बाद पैटर्सन का एक फूड डिहाइड्रेटर को ठिकाने लगाने के लिए स्थानीय कचरा स्थल का दौरा करना और एक अजीबोगरीब फेसबुक पोस्ट शामिल है जिसमें एक 'बिल्ली' द्वारा मशरूम खाने का उल्लेख था (हालांकि उसके पास कोई बिल्ली नहीं थी), जिसे अभियोजकों ने ज़हर में उसकी रुचि के सबूत के तौर पर पेश किया। एरीन पैटर्सन की सज़ा सुनाने की सुनवाई 25 अगस्त को होनी तय है।",en,[],,"One alleged attempt left Simon Patterson in a coma, with his family twice told to say their goodbyes.",[''],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Having restricted Fire to 143-9, Superchargers got off to a blistering start as the England opener put on 91 with Dawid Malan, who hit 41 from 29, for the first wicket. Crawley was given a life on 45 - one of three costly drops from the Fire in the innings - and made the most of his good fortune to reach his highest Hundred score, on his Superchargers debut, to get them over the line with 11 balls to spare. The Superchargers might have expected to be chasing more on a good surface at Headingley, especially when Jonny Bairstow and Steve Smith got the Fire off to a rapid start with a 62-run stand.

The experts opine that the rule quoted by the Karnataka Chief Electoral Officer and subsequently CEOs of Maharashtra and Haryana asking the Leader of the Opposition to submit his complaint and evidence regarding it under an oath or declaration has no application to the present case and is valid only if any complaint is filed within 30 days of the publication of draft Electoral Rolls before elections. Also read: Congress protest over ‘vote theft’ in Karnataka updates Mr. Gandhi claimed in a press conference on Friday (August 7, 2025) that 1,00,250 “fake votes” were created in the Mahadevapura Assembly seat under the Bangalore Central Lok Sabha constituency in Karnataka in order to ensure a win for the BJP. Following this, the Karnataka Chief Electoral Officer had issued a letter to the Congress leader asking him to submit the evidence under oath under Rule 20 (3) (b) of the Registration of Electors Rules 1960. The rule says that “the registration officer shall hold a summary inquiry into every claim or objection in respect of which notice has been given under rule 19 and shall record his decision thereon”. “The registration officer may in his discretion (a) require any claimant, objector or person objected to, to appear in person before him; (b) require that the evidence tendered by any person shall be given on oath and administer an oath for the purpose”. According to Constitution Law expert P.D.T. Achary, “These rules do not apply in this situation. These rules apply till 30 days after draft rolls are published”. “In this case elections were held 15 months back (Lok Sabha polls 2024) and the Congress party has investigated the entire issue on its own now. These rules have no application whatsoever to the present case,” he said, adding, “they (ECI) are wrong to invoke this rule.” Concurring with him, former Chief Election Commissioner O. P. Rawat told The Hindu that the rule quoted by the ECI is more applicable in cases like the Special Intensive Revision of Electoral Rolls, which is currently on in Bihar. Senior lawyer Kapil Sibal said asking Mr. Gandhi to file the affidavit was “a joke” since no inquiry can take place under the rule now. “They are asking for affidavit to be filed and under a rule in which no inquiry can take place. It is a joke in itself. They will go to the people saying that Rahul Gandhi has been asked to submit an affidavit, but will not tell that no action can be taken under the said rule,” he said. According to Mr. Achary, since the ECI is a constitutional body entrusted with the preparation of Electoral Rolls under Article 324, it should be the duty of the poll body to enquire into allegations regarding serious frauds.","The Election Commission of India's (ECI) demand for Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to submit an affidavit under oath regarding his allegations of voter roll manipulation has been widely criticized by electoral law experts as ""infructuous"" and misapplied.

Gandhi had publicly claimed on Friday, August 7, 2025, that 1,00,250 ""fake votes"" were created in the Mahadevapura Assembly constituency, part of the Bangalore Central Lok Sabha seat. Following this, the Karnataka Chief Electoral Officer, echoed by CEOs in Maharashtra and Haryana, requested Gandhi to provide evidence under oath, citing Rule 20(3)(b) of the Registration of Electors Rules 1960.

However, electoral law experts, including P.D.T.T. Achary and former Chief Election Commissioner O. P. Rawat, assert that Rule 20(3)(b) is inapplicable in this scenario. They explain that this rule governs summary inquiries into claims or objections *only* within 30 days after the publication of *draft electoral rolls*. Since the Lok Sabha elections were held 15 months prior (2024), and the Congress party conducted its own investigation post-election, the rule has no relevance.

Senior lawyer Kapil Sibal further dismissed the ECI's request as 'a joke,' highlighting that no inquiry can legally take place under the cited rule at this stage, making the affidavit request moot. Experts argue that as a constitutional body entrusted with electoral roll preparation, the ECI has a duty to proactively investigate serious allegations of fraud, rather than using an inapplicable rule to evade action.","**भारत निर्वाचन आयोग (ECI) की मांग कि कांग्रेस नेता राहुल गांधी मतदाता सूची में हेरफेर के अपने आरोपों के संबंध में शपथ के तहत एक हलफनामा (शपथ पत्र) दाखिल करें, को चुनाव कानून विशेषज्ञों द्वारा व्यापक रूप से ""निष्फल"" और गलत तरीके से लागू किया गया बताकर आलोचना की गई है।**

गांधी ने शुक्रवार, 7 अगस्त, 2025 को सार्वजनिक रूप से दावा किया था कि महादेवपुरा विधानसभा क्षेत्र में 1,00,250 ""फर्जी वोट"" बनाए गए थे, जो बेंगलुरु सेंट्रल लोकसभा सीट का हिस्सा है। इसके बाद, कर्नाटक के मुख्य निर्वाचन अधिकारी ने, जिसका समर्थन महाराष्ट्र और हरियाणा के सीईओ ने भी किया, गांधी से पंजीकरण ऑफ इलेक्टर्स रूल्स 1960 के नियम 20(3)(b) का हवाला देते हुए शपथ के तहत सबूत प्रस्तुत करने का अनुरोध किया।

हालांकि, चुनाव कानून विशेषज्ञों, जिनमें पी.डी.टी.टी. आचार्य और पूर्व मुख्य चुनाव आयुक्त ओ.पी. रावत शामिल हैं, का कहना है कि नियम 20(3)(b) इस स्थिति में लागू नहीं होता। वे बताते हैं कि यह नियम दावों या आपत्तियों की त्वरित जांच को *केवल* मसौदा मतदाता सूची के प्रकाशन के 30 दिनों के भीतर नियंत्रित करता है। चूंकि लोकसभा चुनाव 15 महीने पहले (2024 में) हुए थे, और कांग्रेस पार्टी ने चुनाव के बाद अपनी खुद की जांच की थी, इसलिए इस नियम की कोई प्रासंगिकता नहीं है।

वरिष्ठ वकील कपिल सिब्बल ने ECI के अनुरोध को 'एक मज़ाक' बताते हुए खारिज कर दिया, यह रेखांकित करते हुए कि इस स्तर पर उद्धृत नियम के तहत कोई कानूनी जांच नहीं हो सकती, जिससे शपथ पत्र का अनुरोध निरर्थक हो जाता है। विशेषज्ञों का तर्क है कि एक संवैधानिक निकाय के रूप में, जिसे मतदाता सूची तैयार करने का जिम्मा सौंपा गया है, ECI का कर्तव्य है कि वह धोखाधड़ी के गंभीर आरोपों की सक्रिय रूप से जांच करे, बजाय इसके कि कार्रवाई से बचने के लिए एक अनुपयोगी नियम का उपयोग करे।",en,[],,Election Commission's response to Rahul Gandhi's complaint on voter roll manipulation under oath is questioned by experts.,"['rahul gandhi on vote fraud', 'rahul gandhi on voter fraud', 'rahul gandhi voting fraud allegations', 'Rahul Gandhi on ECI', 'Karnataka lok sabha polls']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""I am very happy as this is the first event that I started with and to win a world cup gold in it…I am just happy that some of my goals are being reached,"" Singh said. Speaking on the next challenges ahead, she said, ""Yes obviously the world championship is the next big one for the year. We are training very hard for it and I am sure you will see very good things from the Indian team in Cairo."" On her mindset in the final, she said: ""Yes I am aware of things like India has not won a medal yet and that there are great shooters in the field, but I have played many finals against these guys and its them all the time so I now know that the pistol is in my hand and the battle is with me so I try to enjoy the match as much as possible.""

It featured a poem written in Kashmiri, the language spoken in the region. To his surprise, he struggled to read it. It made him wonder how his generation had slowly drifted away from their mother tongue, as other languages like English, Urdu and Hindi became more widespread. With that realisation, he launched a social media page - called Muneer Speaks - to preserve and promote Kashmiri culture. Five years on, his profile has garnered over 500 million impressions across Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. ""I want to tell stories about our places and histories, our proverbs, folklore and poetry,"" he says. ""It's about capturing the way we have lived, laughed, cooked and remembered."" Mr Dar is among an emerging group of young content creators using digital platforms to preserve fragments of Kashmir's heritage. The region, divided between India and Pakistan and claimed by both, has been scarred by decades of conflict, and has lost thousands of lives to insurgency. In recent years, many young people have left Kashmir - some to escape violence, others in search of better opportunities. But now, a new generation is changing the narrative - highlighting art, tradition, and daily life, beyond the unrest and violence. When Mr Dar started his social media page, the focus was on Kashmiri language. But over the past five years, his work has expanded into a mix of content, featuring photographs of old architecture, cultural lore and stories behind local delicacies. Getty Images Creators say they want to reclaim Kashmir's rich history and heritage from the narrative of violence In one of his popular videos, Mr Dar shares surprising facts about the area's architecture - like how people once used eggs to help hold buildings together. Meanwhile, the Instagram page, Museum of Kashmir, is taking a broader approach to archiving. The page is run by 33-year-old journalist Muhammad Faysal, who, with a team of curators and oral historians, documents Kashmir's overlooked artefacts and traditions. Videos of vibrant mosque ceilings and poetry recitals feature alongside captions that offer quick, insightful context. Followers say the page helps them see Kashmir's history in a new light. ""Heritage isn't just about grand monuments"", one follower commented, ""but about the things people carried when they left their homes, books, shawls and family recipes"". Experts say content creators must stay accurate, especially with oral histories that can lose detail over time. The rise in Kashmiri storytelling offers a ""vital counter-narrative"", but rushed documentation can blur nuances, according to author and researcher Khalid Bashir Ahmad. Sheikh Adnan Sheikh Adnan's Instagram page focuses on the history and beauty of the famed wool scarves To ensure authenticity, creators say they rely on researchers who cross-check their content with published sources, while preserving the original context. On Instagram, 31-year-old filmmaker Sheikh Adnan runs 'Shawlwala', a page dedicated to Kashmir's iconic Pashmina scarves (called shawls) - handwoven from the fine wool of Himalayan goats and celebrated as both heritage and luxury. ""Our shawls are not just fabric,"" he says, emphasising that most of his subjects are elderly artisans who spin, dye and weave each thread. His goal is to shift the narrative by ""taking the scarves beyond fashion and tourism"" and presenting them as ""examples of Kashmir's history and resilience"". ""They are maps of touch, skill and generations. Every thread carries a story."" One widely shared video shows a woman spinning yarn on a traditional hand spindle as a Kashmiri folk song plays in the background. ""I want people to see the story of an unsung Kashmiri woman spinning thread with love,"" Mr Adnan says. Not all preservation work is serious. Some young artists are creating content with a dash of sarcasm. For 22-year-old Seerat Hafiz, known online as Yikvot or Nun Chai with Jiya, satire and humour are her tools of choice. Her videos are a mix of wordplay and cultural commentary and cover a range of topics from local literature to Kashmiri translations of English classics. In one post, she uses viral memes to show ""why reading native literature helps save the language"". In another, an illustration of a man and woman appears with a Kashmiri translation of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights playing in the background. ""In a way, I'm documenting the thoughts and emotions of young Kashmiris,"" Ms Hafiz says. ""We are constantly switching languages, identities, platforms but we still carry the grief of our history, even in our humour."" Getty Images The pashmina shawl, made from high-quality wool, is synonymous with Kashmiri luxury","A new generation of young Kashmiris is leveraging digital platforms to preserve and promote their rich cultural heritage, language, and history, offering a vital counter-narrative to decades of conflict and migration.

The movement gained momentum with Muneer Ahmad Dar, whose struggle to read a Kashmiri poem inspired him to launch ""Muneer Speaks"" on social media. Initially focused on the Kashmiri language, his platform, now boasting over 500 million impressions, has expanded to chronicle local architecture, folklore, proverbs, and daily life, showcasing the region's heritage beyond unrest.

Other creators include Muhammad Faysal, whose ""Museum of Kashmir"" Instagram page archives overlooked artifacts and traditions with insightful context, helping followers see history anew. Sheikh Adnan's ""Shawlwala"" highlights the intricate history and cultural significance of Pashmina scarves, shifting their narrative beyond luxury and tourism to represent Kashmiri resilience and skill, often featuring elderly artisans.

Even humor plays a role, with artist Seerat Hafiz (Yikvot) using satire and memes to discuss native literature, language preservation, and the complex emotions of young Kashmiris who navigate multiple identities while still carrying the grief of their history.

While experts emphasize the need for accuracy, particularly with oral histories, these diverse digital efforts are collectively reclaiming Kashmir's rich and multifaceted legacy, capturing how people have lived, laughed, and remembered through accessible online storytelling.","यहाँ अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

कश्मीरी युवाओं की एक नई पीढ़ी अपनी समृद्ध सांस्कृतिक विरासत, भाषा और इतिहास को संरक्षित और बढ़ावा देने के लिए डिजिटल प्लेटफॉर्म का उपयोग कर रही है, जो दशकों के संघर्ष और पलायन के सामने एक महत्वपूर्ण प्रति-कथा प्रस्तुत करती है।

इस आंदोलन को मुनीर अहमद डार से गति मिली, जिन्हें एक कश्मीरी कविता पढ़ने में हुई कठिनाई ने सोशल मीडिया पर ""मुनीर स्पीक्स"" शुरू करने के लिए प्रेरित किया। शुरुआत में कश्मीरी भाषा पर केंद्रित, उनका प्लेटफॉर्म, जो अब 500 मिलियन से अधिक इंप्रेशन बटोर चुका है, स्थानीय वास्तुकला, लोककथाओं, कहावतों और दैनिक जीवन का वर्णन करने के लिए विस्तृत हो गया है, जो अशांति से परे क्षेत्र की विरासत को प्रदर्शित करता है।

अन्य रचनाकारों में मुहम्मद फैसल शामिल हैं, जिनका इंस्टाग्राम पेज ""म्यूजियम ऑफ कश्मीर"" अनदेखी कलाकृतियों और परंपराओं को गहन संदर्भ के साथ संग्रहित करता है, जिससे अनुयायियों को इतिहास को नए सिरे से देखने में मदद मिलती है। शेख अदनान का ""शॉलवाला"" पश्मीना शॉल के जटिल इतिहास और सांस्कृतिक महत्व को उजागर करता है, उनके वर्णन को विलासिता और पर्यटन से परे ले जाकर कश्मीरी लचीलेपन और कौशल का प्रतिनिधित्व करने के लिए, जिसमें अक्सर बुजुर्ग कारीगरों को दिखाया जाता है।

यहां तक कि हास्य भी एक भूमिका निभाता है, जिसमें कलाकार सीरत हाफिज (यिकवोट) व्यंग्य और मीम्स का उपयोग कर स्थानीय साहित्य, भाषा संरक्षण और उन युवा कश्मीरियों की जटिल भावनाओं पर चर्चा करते हैं, जो कई पहचानों के बीच संतुलन बनाते हुए भी अपने इतिहास के गम को साथ लिए हुए हैं।

हालांकि विशेषज्ञ सटीकता की आवश्यकता पर जोर देते हैं, खासकर मौखिक इतिहास के मामले में, ये विविध डिजिटल प्रयास सामूहिक रूप से कश्मीर की समृद्ध और बहुआयामी विरासत को वापस हासिल कर रहे हैं, सुलभ ऑनलाइन कहानी कहने के माध्यम से यह दर्शाते हुए कि लोग कैसे जीते, हँसते और याद करते रहे हैं।",en,[],,"Young Kashmiris are using social media to preserve language, heritage and identity through storytelling.",[''],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""I was always homesick at the care home. I am so happy and thankful to be back."" The trio say they were taken out of the convent against their will in December 2023. ""We weren't asked,"" Sister Bernadette said. ""We had the right to stay here until the end of our lives and that was broken."" When the nuns returned to Schloss Goldenstein, the convent had no water or power, but the school was still functioning The three nuns have spent much of their lives at Schloss Goldenstein, a castle which has been a convent and a private girls' school since 1877. The school, which started accepting boys in 2017, is still functioning. Sister Bernadette attended the school herself, arriving as a teenager in 1948. One of her fellow students was the Austrian film actress Romy Schneider. Sister Regina arrived at the convent in 1958, and Sister Rita four years later. All three went on to work at the school as teachers for many years. Sister Regina was headmistress. But the numbers of nuns dwindled. In 2022, the building was taken over by the Archdiocese of Salzburg and the Reichersberg Abbey, an Augustinian monastery. Provost Markus Grasl from the abbey became the nuns' superior. The community was officially dissolved at the beginning of 2024, and the remaining nuns were granted lifelong right of residence, as long as their health and mental capacity allowed. @nonnen_goldenstein Sister Bernardette is far happier back at the convent serving plum dumplings to Sister Rita In December 2023, the decision was made to transfer them to a Catholic care home, where they were unhappy. At the beginning of September, Sister Bernadette, Sister Rita and Sister Regina moved back, helped by a group of former students. ""I have been obedient all my life, but it was too much,"" Sister Bernadette said. They packed up a few belongings and came back to the convent. The locks to their former apartments had been changed so a locksmith was called. When they first arrived, there was no electricity or water. In a statement, Provost Grasl said the nuns' decision to return to the convent was ""completely incomprehensible"" and ""an escalation"". ""The rooms in the convent are no longer usable and in no way meet the requirements for proper care,"" he said. He said the nuns' ""precarious health conditions"" meant ""that independent living at Goldenstein Convent was no longer possible"". Grasl said the old people's home had provided them with ""absolutely essential, professional, and good medical care"". Many of the nuns' wishes about the future of the convent had been taken into account, he added, including the continuation of the school. Provost Markus Grasl says the rooms at the convent are no longer usable and the nuns' decision to return is incomprehensible","Three elderly Austrian nuns – Sister Bernadette (88), Sister Regina (86), and Sister Rita (82) – have defiantly fled a Catholic care home to return to their former Kloster Goldenstein convent in the Alps. The trio, who had been transferred to the care home against their will in December 2023, expressed profound happiness to be back, citing homesickness and a belief that their lifelong right to reside at the convent was broken.

With the help of former students and a locksmith, the nuns regained access to the convent, which initially lacked water and electricity. Sister Bernadette stated, ""I have been obedient all my life, but it was too much.""

Church authorities, however, are displeased. Provost Markus Grasl, the nuns' superior, called their decision ""completely incomprehensible"" and ""an escalation."" He argued that the convent's rooms are no longer suitable for living and do not meet care requirements, citing the nuns' ""precarious health conditions"" as a reason they require professional medical care that the care home provided. The convent community was officially dissolved in early 2024, with residence rights granted only if health and mental capacity allowed independent living.","तीन वृद्ध ऑस्ट्रियाई ननें – सिस्टर बर्नाडेट (88), सिस्टर रेजिना (86) और सिस्टर रीटा (82) – अल्प्स में स्थित अपने पूर्व क्लॉस्टर गोल्डनस्टीन कॉन्वेंट (एकांताश्रम) में लौटने के लिए विरोध करते हुए एक कैथोलिक केयर होम से निकल गईं। दिसंबर 2023 में जिन्हें उनकी इच्छा के विरुद्ध केयर होम में स्थानांतरित किया गया था, उन तीनों ननों ने वापस आकर गहरी खुशी व्यक्त की। उन्होंने इसके पीछे घर की याद (होमसिकनेस) और इस विश्वास का हवाला दिया कि कॉन्वेंट में रहने का उनका आजीवन अधिकार तोड़ा गया था।

पूर्व छात्रों और एक ताला बनाने वाले की मदद से ननों ने कॉन्वेंट में दोबारा प्रवेश प्राप्त किया, जहाँ शुरू में पानी और बिजली नहीं थी। सिस्टर बर्नाडेट ने कहा, ""मैं जीवन भर आज्ञाकारी रही हूँ, लेकिन यह बहुत ज़्यादा था।""

हालांकि, चर्च अधिकारी इस बात से अप्रसन्न हैं। ननों के सुपीरियर (वरिष्ठ) प्रॉवोस्ट मार्कस ग्रासल ने उनके इस निर्णय को ""पूरी तरह से समझ से परे"" और ""स्थिति को गंभीर बनाने वाला"" बताया। उन्होंने तर्क दिया कि कॉन्वेंट के कमरे अब रहने लायक नहीं हैं और देखभाल की ज़रूरतों को पूरा नहीं करते हैं। उन्होंने ननों की ""नाजुक स्वास्थ्य स्थिति"" का हवाला देते हुए कहा कि उन्हें पेशेवर चिकित्सा देखभाल की आवश्यकता है, जो केयर होम प्रदान कर रहा था। कॉन्वेंट समुदाय को 2024 की शुरुआत में आधिकारिक तौर पर भंग कर दिया गया था, और रहने के अधिकार तभी दिए जाते थे जब स्वास्थ्य और मानसिक क्षमता स्वतंत्र जीवन के अनुकूल होती थी।",en,[],,"Sisters Bernadette, Regina and Rita needed a locksmith to get back into their convent, defying Church leaders.",[''],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are seen boarding a dinghy and motoring away into the darkness of the Caribbean Sea, headed for their luxury yacht, anchored in the next bay. This CCTV footage - never made public before and released exclusively now to the BBC - contains the last-recorded sighting of British woman Sarm Heslop in 2021. Some six hours later, she would be reported missing, feared lost at sea. Ryan Bane, her boyfriend at the time, maintains she most likely fell overboard, or drowned while swimming, while he was sleeping. He has never been formally questioned by the police. Despite a massive search operation, Sarm's body has never been found and her disappearance remains a mystery. To try to establish the truth, I spent a month in the US Virgin Islands investigating the case for a BBC Three documentary - speaking to the police who led the investigation, the coastguard and possible witnesses. Family handout Sarm's friends say she was ""always up for a new challenge"" Described by her friends as a ""free spirit"", former flight attendant Sarm, originally from Southampton, left the UK in 2019 to sail across the Atlantic with friends on a small boat. ""She was always up for a new challenge. Totally run-of-the-mill for Sarm to just be doing something bonkers,"" one of her friends Zan tells me. Accompanied by friend Kate and Kate's boyfriend, Sarm headed for the Caribbean - visiting St Lucia, Guadeloupe, Dominica and Martinique. Seven months into the trip, Sarm met Ryan Bane, 49, an American boat captain who chartered his £500,000 catamaran - Siren Song - to wealthy tourists. They dated, Sarm stayed on Mr Bane's yacht, and - after three months - the relationship turned serious. Sarm then decided to work as a chef on the yacht and, on 7 March, 2021, completed her first charter. That night, she disappeared, leaving behind her passport, phone and money. She was 41. Facebook Mr Bane has never spoken publicly about the case While Sarm's friends and family have tried to keep her story in the media spotlight, and enlisted an investigator to help, her mum Brenda says she accepts her daughter is dead. But the hope they will establish what happened, she says, is what keeps them going. ""We still haven't been able to grieve properly. We all deserve to know what happened to her and to bring her home. It's just so, so unfair,"" says Brenda. One key piece of evidence I wanted to see was CCTV showing the last recorded sighting of Sarm, which had never been made public by police. So, when the islands' chief of police, Steven Phillip, handed it to me, I was surprised. ""We're at a dead end,"" he admitted. ""If anybody could look at this video and see something and say something it can help. That's why now."" Sarm's mum had previously watched a small section of the footage, but Sarm's friends had not seen any of it. They hoped they might spot something in the way the couple interacted with each other that night, which would provide answers. But when I showed the footage to them - crowded round a kitchen table - they admitted that beyond confirming that she did get on board the dinghy, the CCTV didn't tell them much - and it could be interpreted in a variety of ways. Missing in Paradise: Searching for Sarm will be on iPlayer from 0600 on Wednesday 17 September, and on BBC Two that evening at 22:00 But I did notice an inconsistency with the timestamp on the CCTV. In reports released by the US Coast Guard, Mr Bane stated the couple had returned to the yacht at 22:00 local time. But the timestamp - which police say they have confirmed is correct - shows them motoring away from the Cruz Bay dinghy dock at 20:45 local time. Having also travelled this route, I know it should take five to 10 minutes in a dinghy to get to the next bay, so they would have got back by 21:00. This means there is a missing hour that Mr Bane has never accounted for. ""The timeline is suspicious, and that's one of the reasons why we need to talk to Ryan,"" says US Virgin Islands' police commissioner, Mario Brooks. But Mr Bane's lawyer, David Cattie, told us this characterisation of the timeline was ""irresponsible"". Commissioner Brooks told us Mr Bane remained the only person of interest in the case. ""There was… nothing of evidentiary value that points to Sarm having contact with anyone that night, outside of Ryan,"" he said. Lawyer David Cattie says there is no evidence Mr Bane ""had a hand"" in Sarm's disappearance While Mr Bane has never spoken publicly about the case, his lawyer agreed to be interviewed on his client's behalf, for the first time. Asked what happened when Sarm disappeared, David Cattie said Mr Bane believed Sarm perhaps hit her head and fell overboard, or had become disorientated while swimming, lost her way and drowned. The timeline inconsistency that evening reflected nothing other than a possible error in estimating the time while under the stress of trying to locate Mr Bane's missing girlfriend, he added. Mr Bane said he discovered Sarm was missing at 02:00 local time. His subsequent actions have been questioned by all the boat captains and experts I have spoken to. There were two other boats anchored in Frank's Bay at the time. I contacted the captains from both, who confirmed Mr Bane did not alert them to a problem either that night, or the following morning. They also told me that captains are trained to shout a missing person's name, call a mayday, immediately call the coastguard and alert neighbouring boats. Mr Cattie acknowledges Mr Bane didn't do everything ""you would say a boat captain is absolutely supposed to do"". ""But we're not here because you're saying, 'well, Ryan didn't follow all the boat protocol'. You're here because people are suggesting he had a hand in her disappearance. There's no evidence of that, at all."" 'Minutes count' I obtained a police timeline and US Coast Guard reports that cover the hours after Sarm was reported missing. Mr Bane said he had woken up when he heard the anchor alarm - which rings if the boat is straying from its mooring - and realised that Sarm was no longer on the yacht. At 02:44 local time - having called them 10 minutes before - Mr Bane gave a brief statement to police when he arrived ashore on his dinghy. From this point onwards though, Mr Bane's account differs from that of the police. His lawyer tells me police had left Mr Bane with the impression that they would contact the coastguard. However, police statements describe how officers had, instead, told Mr Bane to call the coastguard. It was nine hours after having initially reported Sarm missing to police when Mr Bane did eventually call the coastguard - at 11:46 local time. ""Ultimately it's always the captain's responsibility [when a person is missing],"" says Cdr Jan League from the US Coast Guard. ""Minutes count at that point. So waiting nine hours is decreasing the possibility of finding a person in the water."" Family handout Sarm's disappearance is still classified as a missing person's case The US Coast Guard search began 11 hours after Sarm was reported missing to police. Boats and a helicopter combed the water and coastline around where Siren Song was anchored. It is very rare for somebody to fall overboard and for their body to never be found, Cdr League tells me. ""In the three years I have been here, we've had people go overboard, but we've never had the body go missing,"" he says. Mr Bane has used his rights under the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution - which prohibits unreasonable government searches and seizures - to block a forensics team from searching his yacht. The only search that did take place was an initial safety sweep by the coastguard. Mr Bane has also used the Fifth Amendment - the right to not give evidence that may self-incriminate - to decline questioning by police. Mr Cattie said he had advised Mr Bane to invoke his rights. ""One thing you learn with being a lawyer is that there are tonnes of people who had nothing to hide, who had done nothing wrong,"" he said. ""That… just want to do all this cooperation, that wind up in jail for something they didn't do."" Five weeks later after reporting Sarm missing, Mr Bane left the US Virgin Islands. He has never returned. He later tried to sell the yacht. 'Scariest thing' To find out more about what Ryan Bane was like, I tracked down his ex-wife, Cori Stevenson. They married in 2008, then in 2011 he attacked her after they attended a wedding. He knocked her to the ground, she says, ""grabbed my hair and he smashed it [my head] in the floor"", breaking her front teeth. ""He choked me and I passed out,"" she adds. ""When he was in that weird rage… his eyes would go completely black,"" she says. ""That was probably the scariest thing. So I was like, 'I'm going to die today'."" Ryan Bane was given a 60-day sentence for domestic violence simple assault. The couple divorced in 2014. Mr Cattie acknowledges Mr Bane was convicted in that single case - but he adds: ""There's absolutely no indication that he ever had a violent altercation with Sarm."" Family handout Sarm's mum says she was ""the love of my life""","A new BBC documentary has exclusively released previously unseen CCTV footage showing the last recorded moments of British woman Sarm Heslop, who vanished from a luxury yacht in the US Virgin Islands in March 2021. Her disappearance remains a mystery, and her boyfriend at the time, Ryan Bane, is the sole person of interest in a case where her body has never been found.

Heslop, a 41-year-old ""free spirit"" from Southampton, met American boat captain Ryan Bane in 2019 and became a chef on his catamaran. On March 7, 2021, after her first charter, CCTV shows Heslop and Bane boarding a dinghy at Cruz Bay dock at 20:45, heading towards their yacht anchored in the next bay.

Six hours later, around 02:00, Bane reported Heslop missing, claiming she likely fell overboard or drowned while swimming, while he was sleeping. However, the confirmed CCTV timestamp contradicts Bane's statement that they returned to the yacht at 22:00, creating a ""missing hour"" that Bane has not accounted for, which the US Virgin Islands police commissioner calls ""suspicious.""

Investigators also question Bane's actions following the disappearance. Despite being the captain, he waited nine hours until 11:46 to call the US Coast Guard after initially reporting Heslop missing to police at 02:44. Coast Guard officials emphasize that ""minutes count"" in such situations, and Bane's delay significantly reduced the chances of finding her. Bane's lawyer acknowledges he didn't follow all protocols but denies his client had any hand in Heslop's disappearance, citing a lack of evidence.

Bane, who has a 2011 domestic violence conviction for assaulting his ex-wife, invoked his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights, blocking a forensic search of his yacht and declining questioning by police. Five weeks after Heslop's disappearance, Bane left the US Virgin Islands and later unsuccessfully attempted to sell the yacht.

Despite a massive search, Heslop's body has never been found, a rare occurrence for someone falling overboard. Police chief Steven Phillip, admitting they are ""at a dead end,"" released the CCTV footage to the BBC, hoping the public might spot something to help solve the case. Heslop's family, including her mother Brenda, accept she is dead but desperately seek answers to properly grieve. The BBC Three documentary ""Missing in Paradise: Searching for Sarm"" aims to shed light on the unsolved mystery.","यहाँ उस अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

**अमेरिकी वर्जिन द्वीप समूह से ब्रिटिश महिला के लापता होने का मामला: नए सीसीटीवी फुटेज में आखिरी पल सामने आए**

एक नई बीबीसी डॉक्यूमेंट्री ने विशेष रूप से पहले कभी न देखे गए सीसीटीवी फुटेज जारी किए हैं, जिसमें ब्रिटिश महिला सार्म हेसलॉप के अंतिम रिकॉर्ड किए गए पल दिखाई दे रहे हैं, जो मार्च 2021 में अमेरिकी वर्जिन द्वीप समूह में एक लग्जरी नौका से गायब हो गई थीं। उनका गायब होना एक रहस्य बना हुआ है, और उस समय के उनके बॉयफ्रेंड रयान बेन इस मामले में एकमात्र संदिग्ध व्यक्ति हैं, जिसमें उनका शव कभी नहीं मिला है।

साउथम्पटन की 41 वर्षीय 'आज़ाद ख्याल' सार्म हेसलॉप 2019 में अमेरिकी नाव कप्तान रयान बेन से मिलीं और उनकी कैटामरान पर शेफ बन गईं। 7 मार्च, 2021 को, अपनी पहली चार्टर यात्रा के बाद, सीसीटीवी फुटेज में हेसलॉप और बेन को रात 8:45 बजे (20:45) क्रूज़ बे डॉक पर एक डिंघी पर सवार होते हुए दिखाया गया है, जो अगली खाड़ी में लंगर डाले हुए उनकी नौका की ओर जा रहे थे।

छह घंटे बाद, लगभग 2:00 बजे, बेन ने हेसलॉप के लापता होने की सूचना दी, यह दावा करते हुए कि जब वह सो रहा था, तब वह शायद नाव से गिर गईं या तैरते समय डूब गईं। हालांकि, पुष्टि किया गया सीसीटीवी टाइमस्टैम्प बेन के इस बयान का खंडन करता है कि वे रात 10:00 बजे (22:00) नौका पर लौट आए थे, जिससे एक ""लापता घंटा"" पैदा हो गया है जिसका बेन ने कोई हिसाब नहीं दिया है, जिसे अमेरिकी वर्जिन द्वीप समूह के पुलिस आयुक्त ""संदिग्ध"" बताते हैं।

जांचकर्ता लापता होने के बाद बेन की कार्रवाइयों पर भी सवाल उठाते हैं। कप्तान होने के बावजूद, उन्होंने सुबह 2:44 बजे पुलिस को हेसलॉप के लापता होने की शुरुआती रिपोर्ट करने के बाद, अमेरिकी तटरक्षक बल को फोन करने के लिए सुबह 11:46 बजे तक नौ घंटे इंतजार किया। तटरक्षक बल के अधिकारियों ने जोर दिया कि ऐसी स्थितियों में ""एक-एक मिनट मायने रखता है"", और बेन की देरी ने उन्हें ढूंढने की संभावनाओं को काफी कम कर दिया। बेन के वकील ने स्वीकार किया कि उन्होंने सभी प्रोटोकॉल का पालन नहीं किया, लेकिन इस बात से इनकार करते हैं कि उनके मुवक्किल का हेसलॉप के गायब होने में कोई हाथ था, जिसका कारण सबूतों की कमी बताया।

बेन, जिस पर 2011 में अपनी पूर्व पत्नी पर हमला करने के लिए घरेलू हिंसा का आरोप सिद्ध हुआ था, ने अपने चौथे और पांचवें संशोधन अधिकारों का आह्वान किया, जिससे उसकी नौका की फोरेंसिक जांच रुक गई और उसने पुलिस द्वारा पूछताछ से इनकार कर दिया। हेसलॉप के गायब होने के पांच हफ्ते बाद, बेन ने अमेरिकी वर्जिन द्वीप समूह छोड़ दिया और बाद में नौका को बेचने का असफल प्रयास किया।

बड़े पैमाने पर तलाशी के बावजूद, हेसलॉप का शव कभी नहीं मिला है, जो नाव से गिरने वाले किसी व्यक्ति के लिए एक दुर्लभ घटना है। पुलिस प्रमुख स्टीवन फिलिप ने यह स्वीकार करते हुए कि वे ""एक गतिरोध पर हैं"", सीसीटीवी फुटेज बीबीसी को जारी किए, यह उम्मीद करते हुए कि जनता कुछ ऐसा देख सकती है जिससे मामले को सुलझाने में मदद मिले। हेसलॉप का परिवार, उनकी मां ब्रेंडा सहित, स्वीकार करता है कि वह मर चुकी हैं, लेकिन ठीक से शोक मनाने के लिए जवाबों की बेसब्री से तलाश कर रहे हैं। बीबीसी थ्री डॉक्यूमेंट्री ""मिसिंग इन पैराडाइज: सर्चिंग फॉर सार्म"" का उद्देश्य इस अनसुलझे रहस्य पर प्रकाश डालना है।",en,[],,"CCTV footage from 2021, released exclusively to the BBC, contains the last-recorded sighting of Sarm Heslop.",[''],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 22-year-old student at Utah Valley University had watched Charlie Kirk's videos for years and credits the conservative firebrand with being a catalyst in his own political involvement. Now, on this Thursday afternoon, moments before his political hero was about to speak on campus, Mr Sperry thought it was time for him to pay it forward by joining its chapter of Turning Point USA - the organisation Kirk co-founded in 2012 to advocate for conservatism on college campuses. Moments after taking his front-row seat to see Kirk speak, Mr Sperry watched in shock as a sniper bullet rang out and blood started pouring from Kirk's neck. The images, he said, he still can't shake, but he thinks the loss will only strengthen the movement Kirk inspired him to join. ""When you try to silence a voice like this, they don't go away - you only amplify it,"" the second-year student said. ""There are now going to be a million Charlie Kirks, and I feel like that's the thing that we need to do."" As the immediate shock of the attack calms, some at Utah Valley University said it has been replaced with a deep sense of resolve to continue what Kirk began. Students with various political ideologies - including those vehemently opposed to Kirk's beliefs - told the BBC they've felt a personal sense of responsibility to ensure healthy debates on college campuses continue. BBC / Christal Hayes Scott Sperry choked up several times describing the moments he witnessed Kirk's death The killing has thrown Utah Valley University into the centre of America's political divide. Soon after Kirk was shot, some who disagreed with him took to social media to blame Kirk, who has openly supported gun ownership. On the right, pundits and politicians said that conservatives were under attack by the ""radical left"". The spotlight has made some students feel the need to step into the ideological fray. ""This is the first political thing we've ever done. We're not political like this,"" first-year student McKinley Shinkle said, while waving signs with his cousin on campus that called Kirk a hero and said they aren't afraid. ""This happening on our campus and then seeing people who are supporting the shooting - it just kind of radicalised us,"" he added, nothing they're both planning to continue political involvement. ""It's changed everything."" Young fans and critics debate Charlie Kirk's political legacy Who is Charlie Kirk shooting suspect Tyler Robinson? Nestled in a valley surrounded by towering mountains, Utah Valley is the biggest university in the state. It sits on a hill, overlooking a crisp blue lake and a 218-feet-tall granite temple for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The state, which is also a conservative stronghold, has the largest concentration of Mormons in the US and religion plays a leading role in this community. Many have expressed confusion about why Kirk was targeted here. Ben Forster, a second-year student, noted how Kirk often stopped in much more liberal-leaning areas where he could have been more of a target. ""This is now where his martyrdom was established,"" he said, reflecting on his university. ""I mean, that is what martyrdom is: He was killed at a debate."" Despite not agreeing with Kirk's stances, Mr Forster attended Wednesday's event in Utah to watch the spectacle and hear the varying viewpoints - something he hopes will not cease at his university and others after the attack. ""I don't care about what his opinions were,"" he said. ""He was exercising his right in a public forum to talk and discuss - and that is a good thing."" The signs of what happened here are everywhere you look near campus. Law enforcement blocking entrances, makeshift memorials with candles and flowers, signs in apartment windows and on roads declaring Kirk a hero after he was gunned down in front of thousands during one of his signature college campus debates. From teenage activist to the heart of the president's inner circle How 33-hour manhunt ended with suspect in custody Some students told the BBC they've been leaning on one another in the aftermath - with some discussing what happens next. It's clear part of that future will include a political awakening for some on campus. Several students made defiant posters, hanging them in their apartment windows with messages reading, ""freedom"" and ""you can't kill the truth"". A campaign-style merch display near campus is selling Trump hats and flags. All day and all night, people drive through the traffic circle entrance to campus, beeping their horns - either supporting or in opposition to Kirk. BBC / Christal Hayes McKinley Shinkle (left) said the deadly shooting had ""changed everything""","A shooting at Utah Valley University (UVU) during an appearance by conservative firebrand Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, has plunged the campus into America's political divide. Student Scott Sperry, a long-time admirer of Kirk, witnessed the fatal shooting, describing it as a shocking event that he believes will only strengthen the movement Kirk inspired.

The incident has sparked a deep sense of resolve among UVU students, including those who vehemently oppose Kirk's beliefs, to ensure healthy campus debates continue. Social media erupted with accusations, with some blaming Kirk and others on both the political left and right decrying attacks from the ""radical left."" This intense scrutiny has prompted many previously apolitical students, like McKinley Shinkle, to become politically active, with Shinkle stating the event ""kind of radicalised us"" and ""changed everything.""

The targeting of Kirk in conservative Utah, a state with a large Mormon population, has caused confusion, as he often spoke in more liberal-leaning areas. Student Ben Forster, while disagreeing with Kirk's stances, defended his right to free speech and described the shooting as establishing Kirk's ""martyrdom.""

In the aftermath, the campus is marked by law enforcement presence, makeshift memorials, and defiant student posters proclaiming ""freedom"" and ""you can't kill the truth.""

So why aren't they being used to solve the housing shortage? There are almost 720,000 empty homes in England.

The U.S. has seen a more than 10% increase in vacant properties over the past five years, while England alone accounts for nearly 720,000 unused homes, a figure projected to grow.

हालांकि, दक्षिण अफ्रीका ने तुरंत पलटवार किया, जब कोल्बे ने एक पास को इंटरसेप्ट करते हुए स्कोर किया और मैच को बराबर ला खड़ा किया। डेमियन मैकेंजी के पेनल्टी से न्यूजीलैंड ने अपनी बढ़त थोड़े समय के लिए फिर से हासिल कर ली, लेकिन इसके बाद स्प्रिंगबोक्स का दबदबा कायम रहा। कोल्बे ने दूसरे हाफ की शुरुआत में अपना दूसरा ट्राई हासिल किया, जिसके बाद मैनी लिबॉक ने एक पेनल्टी स्कोर की। डेमियन विलेमसे, क्वाग्गा स्मिथ, स्नेमन और आंद्रे एस्टरहुइज़ेन ने भी और ट्राइ स्कोर किए, जिसने दक्षिण अफ्रीका के पूर्ण नियंत्रण को दर्शाया।

This is the curse of the skills Rowlands is blessed with. A skilful, clever runner with an innate understanding of space and deft hands, she can apply herself to any position across the backline. She has played for England in every position from 10 to 15, and has even been pencilled in as a fourth-choice scrum-half in case of emergencies. That versatility makes her an ideal bench option, a superb stand-in wherever needed in the backline. Once Kildunne suffered a concussion in the win over Australia - her head whiplashing back on to the turf in a tackle by Samantha Wood - Rowland was always in pole position to step up. While Gloucester-Hartpury's Emma Sing is a specialist full-back, she is only 12 caps into her Test career and yet to show the same consistency and composure as Rowland. Both played in the win over Samoa in the second round of pool matches, with Sing at full-back and Rowland at fly-half. But it was Rowland who caught the eye, scoring 27 points - a Women's Rugby World Cup record for a player in a single match - landing 11 out of 14 conversions and crossing for a try. That score was characteristically smart, slamming on the brakes and stepping out into the blind-side to cross as Samoa were retreating. But her accuracy off the tee will have been reassuring for Mitchell, who has Holly Aitchinson in ahead of regular kicker Zoe Harrison at fly-half for the meeting with Scotland and Sing, England's best place kicker, on the bench. The loss of Kildunne undoubtedly robs England of star power, but it might not weaken them significantly on the pitch. Kildunne's backfield positioning was exposed by Australia last weekend, with the Wallaroos landing several 50-22 kicks, while the England backline has yet to hit its stride in attack. Rowland enjoyed an enterprising 35-minute cameo after replacing Kildunne, creating space and making breaks with teasing running lines out wide.","England's Ellie Kildunne has been ruled out of Sunday's Rugby World Cup quarter-final against Scotland due to a concussion sustained against Australia. Versatile back Helena Rowland will step into the full-back position for the World Cup holders.

Rowland, praised for her exceptional skill, innate understanding of space, and ability to play any backline position from 10 to 15, was the clear choice over specialist full-back Emma Sing, who is less experienced at Test level and will be on the bench. Rowland has a proven track record, having set a Women's Rugby World Cup record with 27 points against Samoa (including 11 conversions and a try), and delivered an enterprising cameo after replacing Kildunne against Australia.

While Kildunne's absence robs England of star power, Rowland's comprehensive abilities and recent form suggest the team may not be significantly weakened. This is partly due to Kildunne's backfield positioning being exploited by Australia last weekend and the England backline generally not having hit its stride. In other team news, Holly Aitchinson will start at fly-half ahead of regular kicker Zoe Harrison.","यहाँ अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

जॉर्जिया में हुंडई के एक प्लांट में अमेरिका की एक बड़ी आव्रजन छापेमारी के दौरान हिरासत में लिए गए 300 से अधिक दक्षिण कोरियाई श्रमिक अपने वतन लौट आए हैं, जिससे एक राजनयिक विवाद खड़ा हो गया है और अमेरिका में भविष्य के निवेश को लेकर चिंताएँ बढ़ गई हैं।

ये श्रमिक उन 475 लोगों में शामिल थे, जिनमें से अधिकांश दक्षिण कोरियाई नागरिक थे, जिन्हें पिछले हफ्ते हुंडई के बैटरी संयंत्र में अवैध रूप से काम करने के आरोप में पकड़ा गया था। वे शुक्रवार को अटलांटा से कोरियाई एयर के एक चार्टर्ड जेट से इंचियोन अंतरराष्ट्रीय हवाई अड्डे पर पहुंचे। कथित तौर पर उनकी रवानगी एक दिन से अधिक समय तक इसलिए विलंबित हुई क्योंकि व्हाइट हाउस ने यह सुनिश्चित करने का निर्देश दिया था कि क्या कोई श्रमिक काम और प्रशिक्षण कार्यक्रमों के लिए अमेरिका में रहना चाहता है; एक दक्षिण कोरियाई नागरिक ने स्थायी निवास (परमानेंट रेसिडेंसी) के लिए अमेरिका में रुकने का फैसला किया है।

इस घटना ने दक्षिण कोरिया में कड़ी प्रतिक्रियाएँ पैदा की हैं। राष्ट्रपति मून जे-इन और हुंडई के मुख्य कार्यकारी ने देश की अर्थव्यवस्था पर इसके ""विनाशकारी प्रभाव"" की चेतावनी दी है, जिससे कंपनियाँ अमेरिका में निवेश करने से बहुत कतरा सकती हैं। दक्षिण कोरियाई अधिकारियों ने अमेरिकी सीनेटरों से गहरी चिंता व्यक्त की है, इस बात पर जोर देते हुए कि विदेशों में कारखाने स्थापित करने में मदद करने के लिए श्रमिकों को भेजना कोरियाई फर्मों के लिए एक सामान्य प्रथा है और उन्होंने उनके लिए एक नई वीज़ा श्रेणी की मांग की है।

हुंडई के सीईओ जोस मुनोज़ ने पुष्टि की कि इस छापेमारी के कारण फैक्ट्री के खुलने में कम से कम दो से तीन महीने का विलंब होगा, क्योंकि कंपनी को अब नए श्रमिकों को खोजना होगा। इंचियोन हवाई अड्डे पर, पत्रकार और प्रदर्शनकारी जमा हुए थे, जिनमें से कुछ के बैनर कोरियाई लोगों की हिरासत की कठोर आलोचना कर रहे थे, जिन्हें ""हथकड़ी में जकड़कर और बड़े अपराधियों जैसा सलूक किया गया"" था। बैनरों में अमेरिका में लगातार निवेश पर भी सवाल उठाए गए थे। थके हुए होने के बावजूद, लौटने वाले श्रमिकों ने राहत महसूस की, एक ने चिल्लाते हुए कहा, ""मैं वापस आ गया हूँ, मैं आज़ाद हूँ।"" दक्षिण कोरिया के विदेश मंत्रालय ने लौट रहे श्रमिकों के लिए गोपनीयता बनाए रखने का अनुरोध किया है।",en,[],,Media and some protesters gather at the airport as more than 300 workers detained in the US last week return.,[''],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The man continually demanded compensation for his injury and even broke into Ms Choi's home with a knife on one occasion, South Korean media reported. In one of South Korea's most contentious rulings on sexual violence, the man was sentenced to six months in prison - suspended for two years - for trespassing and intimidation. He was never charged for attempted rape. Ms Choi received the harsher sentence for causing him grievous bodily harm, with the court saying at the time that her actions exceeded the ""reasonable bounds"" of self-defence.

The case has long been cited in legal textbooks as a classic example of a court failing to recognize self-defense during sexual violence.

The incident occurred when Ms. Choi was 18, pinned to the ground by a 21-year-old man. She managed to escape only after biting off 1.5cm of his tongue. Despite her actions being a desperate act of self-preservation, she was convicted and received a suspended 10-month sentence, with the court ruling her actions exceeded ""reasonable bounds"" of self-defense.

79 वर्षीय चोई माल-जा को यौन उत्पीड़न से अपनी आत्मरक्षा करते हुए अपने हमलावर की जीभ काटने के मामले में दोषी ठहराए जाने के 61 साल बाद गंभीर शारीरिक चोट पहुँचाने के आरोप से बरी कर दिया गया है। इस मामले का लंबे समय से कानूनी पाठ्यपुस्तकों में यौन हिंसा के दौरान आत्मरक्षा को पहचानने में अदालत की विफलता के एक उत्कृष्ट उदाहरण के रूप में हवाला दिया जाता रहा है।

यह घटना तब हुई जब सुश्री चोई 18 साल की थीं और उन्हें एक 21 वर्षीय व्यक्ति ने जमीन पर दबोच लिया था। वह उसकी 1.5 सेमी जीभ काटने के बाद ही भागने में सफल रहीं। आत्म-संरक्षण का एक हताश कार्य होने के बावजूद, उन्हें दोषी ठहराया गया और 10 महीने की निलंबित सज़ा मिली, क्योंकि अदालत ने फैसला सुनाया कि उनके कार्य आत्मरक्षा की ""उचित सीमाओं"" से अधिक थे। इसके बिल्कुल विपरीत, उनके हमलावर पर कभी भी बलात्कार के प्रयास का आरोप नहीं लगाया गया। उसे बाद में अतिक्रमण और डराने-धमकाने के अपराधों के लिए हल्की, छह महीने की निलंबित सज़ा मिली थी। उसने बार-बार सुश्री चोई से मुआवज़े की मांग की थी, यहाँ तक कि चाकू लेकर उनके घर में भी घुस गया था।

दशकों तक इस दोषसिद्धि के साथ जीने के बाद, सुश्री चोई ने अपना नाम साफ़ करने के लिए वर्षों लंबा अभियान चलाया। जुलाई में बुसान में एक पुनर्विचारण शुरू हुआ, जहाँ, एक असामान्य कदम उठाते हुए, अभियोजकों ने न केवल उनसे माफी मांगी बल्कि अदालत से उनकी मूल दोषसिद्धि को रद्द करने का भी अनुरोध किया।

सुश्री चोई ने बरी होने पर गहरी राहत व्यक्त की और कहा कि उन्हें न्याय मांगने के लिए मजबूर होना पड़ा, न केवल अपने लिए, बल्कि ""अन्य पीड़ितों के लिए खड़े होने"" और यह सुनिश्चित करने के लिए कि उन्हें ऐसी ही पीड़ा न झेलनी पड़े। उन्होंने सत्ता में बैठे उन लोगों की निंदा की जिन्होंने ""कमजोरों को कुचलने और कानून में हेरफेर करने के लिए अपनी शक्ति का दुरुपयोग किया"", इस बात पर जोर देते हुए कि कैसे प्रारंभिक फैसले ने उन्हें एक पीड़ित से एक आरोपी में बदल दिया था।",en,[],,Choi Mal-ja only managed to break free after biting off about 1.5cm of her alleged attacker's tongue.,[''],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves will outline the government's tax and spending plans with increasing speculation she will raise taxes to meet her self-imposed fiscal rules. The ONS said the service sector grew by 0.4% over the three months to July, helped by a good performance from the health sector, computer programming and office support services.

ONS ने बताया कि जुलाई तक के तीन महीनों में अर्थव्यवस्था में मामूली 0.2% का विस्तार हुआ था, जिसे सेवा क्षेत्र (स्वास्थ्य और प्रौद्योगिकी सहित) में 0.4% की वृद्धि से समर्थन मिला। हालांकि, उत्पादन क्षेत्र में आई गिरावट ने इस विस्तार को काफी हद तक बेअसर कर दिया। विशेष रूप से, जुलाई में विनिर्माण उत्पादन में 1.3% की गिरावट दर्ज की गई – यह पिछले साल के बाद से इसकी सबसे तेज़ मासिक गिरावट है और मंदी की शुरुआत के बाद से ब्रिटेन में सबसे बड़ी गिरावट है।

इस आर्थिक गतिरोध ने सरकार पर अपनी विकास प्राथमिकताओं को पूरा करने का दबाव बढ़ा दिया है। वित्त मंत्री राचेल रीव्स से उम्मीद की जा रही है कि वह अपने आगामी बजट में कर और खर्च की योजनाओं को रेखांकित करेंगी, जिसमें राजकोषीय नियमों को पूरा करने के लिए करों में वृद्धि की अटकलें लगाई जा रही हैं। यह डेटा 18 सितंबर को बैंक ऑफ इंग्लैंड के ब्याज दर के फैसले से पहले भी आया है, जहां नीति निर्माता धीमी पड़ती वृद्धि और लगातार बढ़ती मुद्रास्फीति के बीच संतुलन साधने का प्रयास करेंगे।

Consumer prices increased 2.9% in the year to August, up from 2.7% the previous month, according to the latest figures from the US Labor Department as the cost of cars, household furnishings and grocery staples like tomatoes and beef all rose. The US central bank has kept interest rates unchanged since last year as policymakers continued to monitor the effect of President Donald Trump's import tariffs on consumer prices. Trump and some of his allies have attacked the Fed for not cutting rates at the same pace as other central banks in, for example, the UK and Europe. The Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates next week by a quarter of a percentage point. The new data is unlikely to derail those forecasts but the uptick in inflation is poised to keep policymakers cautious as they weigh rate cuts in the months ahead. ""President Donald Trump's inflationary policies - tariffs and restrictive immigration measures - are gradually showing up in the hard data and continue to erode consumers' purchasing power,"" said Atakan Bakiskan, US economist at banking group Berenberg. Trump has dismissed concerns that his policies will drive up prices or weigh on the economy. Since Trump latest tariffs took effect last month, most goods entering the US face taxes of between 10% and 50%, depending on their origin. The price of tariff-sensitive products - such as clothing and household goods - inched up last month in a sign that more businesses might be passing on costs to consumers. Economists noted that the uptick in food prices, which tend to be volatile, might also be driven in part by Trump administration policies, including tariffs and mass deportations. Inflation data showed that tomato prices rose by 4.5% in August. About 70% of tomatoes consumed in the US are imported from Mexico, according to the Florida Tomato Exchange. In July, the US imposed a 17% tariff on most tomatoes bought in from its southern neighbour. As well as inflation, the Fed has become increasingly focused on job market weakness. Fewer jobs Last week, the Labor Department reported that employers added just 22,000 jobs in August, fewer than expected, while the unemployment rate ticked up from 4.2% to 4.3%. More recently, it said the US economy added 911,000 fewer jobs than initial estimates had suggested in the year to March. And on Thursday, the Labor Department reported a jump in weekly unemployment filings to 263,000 - the highest level in nearly four years. An underlying measure of inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, held steady at 3.1% year-over-year in August. ""Right now, inflation is a key subplot, but the labor market is still the main story,"" said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. ""That translates into a rate cut next week - and, likely, more to come."" BBC/Tommy Lumby","The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point next week, driven primarily by a weakening job market, despite a recent uptick in inflation.

Consumer prices rose 2.9% in August, the fastest pace this year, with increased costs for cars, household furnishings, and grocery staples like tomatoes and beef. This inflation has been linked by economists to President Donald Trump's import tariffs and restrictive immigration policies, with ""tariff-sensitive"" goods and imported tomatoes (which faced a 17% tariff in July) showing price increases. Trump, however, dismisses these concerns, stating his policies are aimed at helping the middle class.

Despite the inflation rise, the central bank's focus remains on the job market, which showed significant weakness. Employers added only 22,000 jobs in August, the unemployment rate climbed to 4.3%, and weekly unemployment filings jumped to a nearly four-year high. While core inflation (excluding food and energy) held steady at 3.1%, analysts consider the labor market ""the main story,"" indicating the upcoming rate cut is likely the first of several, even as policymakers remain cautious due to the inflation uptick.","अमेरिकी फेडरल रिजर्व द्वारा अगले सप्ताह ब्याज दरों में चौथाई प्रतिशत अंक की कटौती करने की व्यापक उम्मीद है। यह कदम मुख्य रूप से कमजोर होते रोजगार बाजार के कारण उठाया जाएगा, भले ही मुद्रास्फीति में हाल ही में वृद्धि हुई हो।

अगस्त में उपभोक्ता कीमतें 2.9% बढ़ीं, जो इस साल की सबसे तेज गति है। इसमें कारों, घरेलू साज-सज्जा और टमाटर व बीफ जैसे आवश्यक किराना सामान की लागत में वृद्धि देखी गई। अर्थशास्त्रियों ने इस मुद्रास्फीति को राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप के आयात शुल्क और प्रतिबंधात्मक आव्रजन नीतियों से जोड़ा है, जिसमें ""टैरिफ-संवेदनशील"" वस्तुएं और आयातित टमाटर (जिन पर जुलाई में 17% टैरिफ लगा था) की कीमतों में वृद्धि देखी गई। हालांकि, ट्रंप इन चिंताओं को खारिज करते हुए कहते हैं कि उनकी नीतियों का उद्देश्य मध्यम वर्ग की मदद करना है।

Relics from another time. Wi-fi connectivity? Apps? Forget about it. These things produced a glow and sound from an earlier era. These TVs weren't any ordinary analogue displays though. They were professional video monitors, or PVMs. The kind of sets that once furnished hospital labs, hooked up to very expensive equipment. Broadcasters also used to have huge numbers of them. Today, PVMs light up the dreams of certain die-hard retro gamers. Joshi is part of a small group of people who scavenge for vintage TVs like this.

""Do you want to go split on this stuff?"" Joshi thought about it for a moment. The TVs were 200 miles away in southern Florida. If this person helped – and the TVs were OK – he'd get half his money back, and potentially even some help hauling the hefty sets back home. As long as this total stranger was as good as their word. He sent his reply: ""Sure.""","Despite being largely replaced by modern flat screens, cathode-ray tube (CRT) televisions from the 1970s and 80s are experiencing a surprising resurgence in demand, particularly professional video monitors (PVMs).

Joshi is part of a niche community of enthusiasts who actively scavenge for these vintage sets, leveraging their networks for competitive advantage. After his purchase, a fellow member of his online group messaged him, offering to split the cost and assist in hauling the hefty TVs 200 miles from southern Florida, an offer Joshi accepted despite the inherent risk of trusting a stranger.","**आधुनिक फ्लैट स्क्रीन द्वारा काफी हद तक प्रतिस्थापित किए जाने के बावजूद, 1970 और 80 के दशक के कैथोड-रे ट्यूब (CRT) टेलीविजन, खासकर प्रोफेशनल वीडियो मॉनिटर (PVMs), मांग में एक आश्चर्यजनक पुनरुत्थान का अनुभव कर रहे हैं। ये कभी आम रहे डिस्प्ले, जिनका मूल रूप से अस्पताल प्रयोगशालाओं और प्रसारकों (broadcasters) जैसी जगहों पर उपयोग किया जाता था, अब अपनी पुरानी यादों भरी तस्वीर गुणवत्ता (nostalgic picture quality) के लिए कट्टर रेट्रो गेमर्स द्वारा अत्यधिक मांग में हैं।**

There are more than 100 different species of the peacock spider, whereas most animals have only five or ten. Researchers believe that's partly down to the spider's 'dark DNA' - a mysterious part of the animal's genetic code, and they are studying it to find out more. They think that this dark DNA might enable it to adapt rapidly to changing environmental circumstances by developing into new species. What the scientists find out, they say, might help to explain why there is so much variation in the natural world.

""When you go outside you see so much variation in species of plants and animals,"" he said. ""Peacock spiders are at the extreme end of that. And so, by studying them, we can use that extreme case to try to understand what processes produce variation in general."" Peacock spiders are found across Australia and each one is the size of a pin head. It is so-named because of the brilliant colours males have on their abdomen, which they show off in a beguiling mating ritual. They create a drumming sound with their feet, a spider song of sorts, and move rhythmically while displaying their dazzlingly patterned features. What is remarkable about these creatures is how varied they are in their appearance, songs and dance moves. Mr Walker used to be scared of spiders, but he overcame his phobia because he was so drawn to the science behind the spiders and took the project on as part of his PhD research. ""When I told friends and family that I was going to study spiders in Australia I got some worried looks and I was obviously apprehensive myself. But just a few seconds of watching them dance was enough for any fears to be washed away."" Mr Walker worked with his group leader, Dr Joana Meier and an international team to collect each and every one of the species discovered so far. They then painstakingly categorised precise details about each one's behaviour, movement and songs. The final piece of the jigsaw was to cross-reference all this information with the DNA of each species. Jonah Walker The flying peacock spider: each different species has different colours and behaviours By comparing the results of each species, they hope to find out which genes are responsible for each trait and ultimately why there are so many different types of peacock spider. The research is a work in progress but the team already has a strong scientific lead to investigate further. ""It is early days, but one of the tantalising things we have discovered is that it may not only be the genes that are responsible for the diversity, but the bits in between, the so-called 'dark DNA', that may influence how spiders evolve,"" says Mr Walker. DNA consists of a long string of molecules. Some parts of them are involved in deciding specific traits. In the case of humans they can decide height or eye colour. These sections are called genes. But the bulk of the sections of DNA are not genes, and no one really knows what they do. The Sanger researchers think that this so-called dark DNA may be responsible for peacock spiders' diversity. They have three times more dark DNA than humans. Jonah Walker Display of the golden peacock spider which has its own dance and song","Scientists are investigating the extraordinary diversity of Australia's peacock spiders, believing a mysterious part of their genetic code, dubbed ""dark DNA,"" holds the key to their rapid evolution into over 100 known species. These tiny, pin-head sized arachnids are famed for their dazzling colors, intricate mating dances, and unique ""spider songs.""

Researchers from the Sanger Institute, led by Jonah Walker, are exploring how this ""dark DNA"" – the bulk of the genetic code whose function is largely unknown – might enable such swift adaptation and speciation. Peacock spiders possess three times more of this non-coding DNA than humans, suggesting its role in their remarkable ability to develop into new forms and survive changing environmental circumstances.

Walker and his international team meticulously collected and categorized each species' behavior, movement, and songs, cross-referencing this data with their DNA. By studying these extreme examples of natural variation, scientists hope to unravel fundamental processes governing diversity across the natural world, potentially even offering insights into the origin of life on Earth. Walker himself, initially fearful of spiders, overcame his phobia to pursue this groundbreaking research.","**ऑस्ट्रेलिया के मोर मकड़ियों के 'डार्क डीएनए' पर शोध: तीव्र विकास का रहस्य**

Swinney claimed the UK government had not sufficiently prioritised whisky in trade discussions with Trump, but that he had ""sorted"" that situation over the summer. The Scottish government is seeking a reduction or removal of 10% import taxes, known as tariffs, on Scotch entering the US - which the whisky industry says costs businesses £4m per week. The BBC understands the UK government is seeking whisky tariff reductions as part of wider trade negotiations with the US. In a statement, a UK government spokesperson said: ""There is huge appetite for our whisky in the US and around the world, and our Trade Strategy will help Scottish firms sell even more products in new markets as part of the Plan for Change. ""We continue to work with the US to get this landmark deal implemented as soon as possible."" Swinney met Trump in the Oval Office during a two-day visit to Washington DC this week. After arriving back in Edinburgh, he said that whisky had not been on Trump's ""radar"" when he visited Scotland in July. ""I sorted that out over the summer, and it's now got the attention that it needs,"" Swinney told reporters. He said: ""A better deal for whisky was not previously on the agenda – and it now very much is. ""But the ball is firmly in the UK government's court. They must press on with the detailed negotiations and try to get a deal over the line."" He warned that Trump ""believes in tariffs"" and that it would not ""be easy"" to negotiate a deal. ""But I think – and I hope – there is now a real chance of a better deal,"" the first minister told reporters. Swinney said that Trump had taken his arguments ""very seriously"" during a 50-minute meeting. The first minister argued that relaxing tariffs would be a ""win-win"" for whisky distillers and US bourbon producers, who sell hundreds of millions of pounds of used barrels to whisky producers each year. The White House Donald Trump and John Swinney had a 50-minute meeting in the Oval Office During his whistlestop visit to Washington DC, Swinney met representatives from whisky industries in Scotland and the US before meeting Trump. The Oval Office talks also covered the conflict in Gaza and Israel's air strikes in Qatar. The UK's ambassador to the US, Lord Peter Mandelson, accompanied the first minister to the White House. Swinney also stayed at the former Labour minister's residence in Washington DC. Mandelson has come under media scrutiny for his past friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. He told the BBC that he ""very much regrets ever having been introduced to Epstein"". Swinney said UK government had been ""helpful"" during his visit and that there had been ""no issues"" with the support given by the embassy. He added that it was up to the prime minister to choose his ambassadors. Tariff fears Trump announced a 10% tariff on most UK good earlier this year, as part of his efforts to boost US industries at the expense of international competitors. The 10% tariff is a base rate, and lower than the 15% tax on EU imports. However, the Scotch Whisky Association says it is costing the industry £4m a week. The US is the biggest Scotch export market, with about a fifth of all exports heading stateside, and was worth about £1bn in 2024 according to the SWA. The industry body has said that the tariffs also damage the US bourbon industry due to a £220m-a-year trade in used casks. The bourbon barrels are sent to Scottish distilleries, where they are used to store maturing whisky. The White House John Swinney and Sir Keir Starmer held talks with Donald Trump when he visited Scotland in July When Trump visited Scotland in the summer he said he did not realise whisky was an issue but agreed to discuss it. Swinney said he raised the issue during talks with the president at his Aberdeenshire golf course in July. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who also held talks with Trump in Scotland, is hoping to negotiate further concessions on the tariffs. The effectiveness of Swinney's and Starmer's efforts is expected to become clearer when Trump makes a state visit to the UK next week. There is also a looming threat of further trade tariffs on single malt whisky, which was subject to a 25% rate during Trump's first presidency. A deal struck to suspend that tax during Joe Biden's time in office is due to expire next summer. The SWA has called for the UK and US governments to agree a permanent settlement to ensure the higher rate is not reimposed, potentially on top of the current 10% tariff.","Scottish First Minister John Swinney has met with Donald Trump, expressing optimism for a ""real chance"" to resolve the 10% US import tariffs on Scotch whisky, which cost the industry £4 million per week. Swinney claims he successfully raised the issue's priority with Trump, who he stated took his arguments ""very seriously"" despite his general belief in tariffs.

While acknowledging the difficulty of negotiations, Swinney presented tariff reduction as a ""win-win"" for both Scottish distillers and US bourbon producers, but stressed that the ""ball is firmly in the UK government's court"" to secure a deal. The UK government, including Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Foreign Secretary William Hague, is also actively pursuing these reductions as part of wider trade discussions, aiming to boost Scottish exports.

The Scotch Whisky Association highlights that these tariffs also negatively impact the US bourbon industry due to the trade in used casks. Adding urgency, a temporary suspension of a 25% tariff on single malt whisky, agreed under the Biden administration, is set to expire next summer, prompting industry calls for a permanent settlement. The effectiveness of the diplomatic efforts is expected to become clearer during Trump's upcoming state visit to the UK.","स्कॉटलैंड के प्रथम मंत्री जॉन स्विनि ने डोनाल्ड ट्रंप से मुलाकात की है और स्कॉच व्हिस्की पर लगे 10% अमेरिकी आयात शुल्क को हल करने की ""वास्तविक संभावना"" पर आशावाद व्यक्त किया है, जिससे इस उद्योग को प्रति सप्ताह 40 लाख पाउंड का नुकसान होता है। स्विनि का दावा है कि उन्होंने ट्रंप के सामने इस मुद्दे को सफलतापूर्वक प्राथमिकता दी, जिन्होंने उनके टैरिफ में सामान्य विश्वास के बावजूद, उनके तर्कों को ""बहुत गंभीरता से"" लिया।

Trump, who previously pledged to end the conflict on ""day one"" of becoming president, is struggling to broker a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv, and Russia's strikes on Ukraine have intensified . The US president made the demand during a meeting between US and EU officials on Tuesday discussing options to increase economic pressure on Russia, a source familiar with the discussions has told the BBC. Donald Trump has called on the European Union (EU) to hit China and India with tariffs of up to 100% to force Russian president Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine. China and India are major buyers of Russian oil, which helps to keep the country's economy and war machine afloat. Last month, the US imposed a 50% tariff on goods from India, which included a 25% penalty for its transactions with Russia. Although the EU has said it would end its dependency on Russian energy, around 19% of its natural gas imports still come from there. If the EU does impose the tariffs on China and India it would mark a change to its approach of attempting to isolate Russia with sanctions rather than levies. Trump's request to the EU, first reported by the Financial Times, follows remarks from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said Washington was prepared to escalate economic pressure but needed stronger European backing Ukraine's main government building in Kyiv was struck by a Russian missile over the weekend - in an attack that was seen as both symbolic and a major increase of aggression by the Kremlin. The strikes across the country marked the heaviest aerial bombardment on Ukraine since the war began. Ukraine said Russian forces used at least 810 drones and 13 missiles. On Tuesday, more than 20 civilians were killed by a Russian glide bomb in the eastern Donbas region, as they queued to collect their pensions. Trump said he was ""not happy with the whole situation"" and threatened harsher sanctions on the Kremlin. The US president has previously pledged harsher measures against Russia, but not taken any action despite Putin ignoring his deadlines and threats of sanctions. A highly anticipated summit between the leaders in Alaska last month ended without a peace deal. Trump also said on Tuesday that the US and India were ""continuing negotiations to address the trade barriers"" between the two countries. He plans to speak to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the coming weeks and expects a ""successful conclusion"" to their trade talks, he wrote on social media. In response, Modi echoed Trump's optimism that the talks would be successful and said the two countries were ""close friends and natural partners."" ""Our teams are working to conclude these discussions at the earliest. I am also looking forward to speaking with President Trump,"" he added. Trump's comments have been seen by some as the latest sign of a reconciliation between Washington and Delhi, after a collapse in their trade negotiations. Last week, Trump emphasised the ""special relationship"" between India and the US, saying ""there's nothing to worry about. We just have moments on occasion"".","U.S. President Donald Trump has urged the European Union (EU) to impose a 100% tariff on goods from China and India. This demand, made during a meeting with US and EU officials, aims to pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war in Ukraine, as both countries are major buyers of Russian oil, which sustains Moscow's economy and war effort.

Trump, who previously pledged to end the conflict on ""day one,"" has struggled to broker a peace deal, and his request follows heavy Russian bombardments across Ukraine, including a deadly strike in Donbas. The US has already imposed a 50% tariff on goods from India, while the EU currently relies on sanctions against Russia, despite still importing 19% of its natural gas from the country. Trump has also expressed dissatisfaction with the ongoing conflict and threatened harsher sanctions on the Kremlin, despite past threats not leading to significant action. He plans to speak with Putin later this week or early next.

Separately, Trump announced ongoing negotiations with India to resolve trade barriers and a dispute over defense equipment, anticipating a ""successful conclusion"" to talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom he plans to speak with soon.

Getty Images AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot announced the firm's $50bn investment in the US in July","AstraZeneca has paused a £200 million investment at its Cambridge research site, which was set to create 1,000 jobs, following an earlier decision to shelve a Liverpool project. This move represents a significant setback for the UK pharmaceutical sector and mirrors US pharmaceutical giant Merck's recent abandonment of a £1 billion UK expansion, including a London King's Cross site, with Merck blaming a lack of government investment and the undervaluing of innovative medicines.

Both companies, along with others in the industry, are increasingly directing investments towards the United States, partly due to pressure from figures like former President Donald Trump and threats of import tariffs. AstraZeneca, for instance, committed $50 billion to US medicines manufacturing and R&D in July, while Merck plans to move its life sciences research there, leading to UK job cuts. This trend comes as UK spending on medicines has fallen from 15% to 9% of the NHS budget over the last decade, significantly below other developed nations.","एस्ट्राजेनेका (AstraZeneca) ने अपने कैम्ब्रिज रिसर्च साइट पर 200 मिलियन पाउंड (लगभग 2,000 करोड़ रुपये) के निवेश को रोक दिया है, जिससे 1,000 नौकरियां सृजित होने वाली थीं। यह फैसला लिवरपूल परियोजना को स्थगित करने के उसके पहले के निर्णय के बाद आया है।

यह कदम यूके के दवा क्षेत्र के लिए एक बड़ा झटका है और यह अमेरिकी दवा दिग्गज मर्क (Merck) द्वारा हाल ही में 1 बिलियन पाउंड (लगभग 10,000 करोड़ रुपये) के यूके विस्तार को छोड़ने के समान है, जिसमें लंदन के किंग्स क्रॉस में एक साइट भी शामिल थी। मर्क ने इसके लिए सरकारी निवेश की कमी और नवोन्मेषी दवाओं के कम मूल्यांकन को जिम्मेदार ठहराया था।

दोनों कंपनियां, उद्योग में अन्य के साथ, बढ़ते हुए अपने निवेश को संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका की ओर निर्देशित कर रही हैं, जिसका एक कारण पूर्व राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प जैसे शख्सियतों का दबाव और आयात शुल्क की धमकियां हैं। उदाहरण के लिए, एस्ट्राजेनेका ने जुलाई में अमेरिकी दवा निर्माण और अनुसंधान एवं विकास (R&D) में 50 बिलियन डॉलर (लगभग 4,16,000 करोड़ रुपये) का निवेश करने का वादा किया, जबकि मर्क अपनी जीवन विज्ञान अनुसंधान इकाई को वहीं स्थानांतरित करने की योजना बना रहा है, जिससे यूके में नौकरियों में कटौती होगी।

यह प्रवृत्ति ऐसे समय में सामने आई है जब पिछले एक दशक में दवाओं पर यूके का खर्च एनएचएस (NHS) के बजट के 15% से घटकर 9% हो गया है, जो अन्य विकसित देशों की तुलना में काफी कम है।",en,[],,Its decision comes as the industry says there is a lack of government investment and as the US pressures firms to invest there.,[''],www.bbc.com/business,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""So many times, we lost our produce due to unpredictable conditions,"" he says. But five years ago he was approached by Sun Master, a Delhi-based solar power firm, with a deal that would give him a much more predictable income. Sun Master proposed building solar panels above some of Mr Dagar's fields, with the panels high enough off the ground, that he could continue to farm underneath them. Under the 25-year deal, Mr Dagar would receive annual payments and Sun Master would keep the proceeds from the electricity generated. ""When the solar company first approached us... many of us feared losing our land. It sounded too good to be true - maybe even a scam,"" says Mr Dagar. ""But today, I believe it was the best decision I made. My income has tripled, and I sleep peacefully without the stress of climate or crop failure,"" he says. Sun Master pays him around $1,200 (£900) per acre, per year, plus $170 a month for work operating and maintaining the solar panels. ""Even the turmeric I grow on the same land is mine to sell. How can I complain?"" Siting solar panels above crops goes by the term agrivoltaics. India would seem particularly suited to such innovation. The fortunes of many of its farmers often hinge on an unpredictable monsoon, so a reliable income from a solar energy firm might provide some welcome financial security. But despite the benefits, take up has been slow, around 40 projects are operating in India at the moment, according to the National Solar Energy Federation of India (NSEFI), which represents India's solar power industry. There are several challenges. Not all crops will grow under solar panels. Depending on the layout, the panels reduce the light getting through by between 15% and 30%. Some denser layouts will block too much sun for staple crops including wheat, rice, soybeans or pulses. ""What works well are high-value crops with moderate or low-light needs, like green leafy vegetables, spices such as turmeric and ginger, and some flowers,"" says Vivek Saraf, the founder and CEO of Delhi-based SunSeed, which specialises in agrivoltaics. There's also the issue of expense. To allow farming underneath, the solar panels need to be at least 11ft (3.5m) off the ground. That makes them between 20% and 30% more expensive to install than panels on a regular solar farm, where they are much closer to the ground. ""Small farmers cannot own these systems. They don't have the risk appetite or capital,"" says Mr Saraf. SunSeed APV SunSeed promises to take the risk out of farming The solar power companies want the government to step in with subsidies to make agrivoltaics more attractive. ""In India, where more than 55% of the population depends on agriculture and cultivable land is under mounting pressure, agrivoltaics offers a transformative model,"" says Subrahmanyam Pulipaka, CEO of NSEFI. ""It reduces irrigation needs, shields crops from heat stress, and stabilizes incomes by diversifying revenue streams for farmers. For rain fed and climate-vulnerable regions, agrivoltaics can play a vital role in climate adaptation, making agriculture more resilient to unpredictable weather patterns,"" he says. SunSeed gives the farmer multiple options, including continuing to farm for a fixed salary, or handing over all the farming responsibility to SunSeed. ""Our model ensures the farmer is not exposed to any risk. If the crop fails or there's a market issue, the loss is ours - not the farmers',"" he says. Meanwhile, SunSeed has been finely tuning its system to work with different crops and conditions. ""We have developed sophisticated agrivoltaics simulation software,"" he says. ""It digitally replicates panel configurations and crop types to simulate how much light and heat each leaf receives, how photosynthesis is affected, and ultimately how much yield to expect."" SunSeed Agrivoltaic projects are still relatively rare in India There's still caution in government circles over the combination of solar power and farming. ""Agrivoltaics is promising, but we must protect both the farmer and the developer,"" says Manu Srivastava, who oversees solar and agrivoltaic projects in the state of Madhya Pradesh. ""The biggest challenge is contracts. A 25-year lease needs clear obligations and protection for both sides. In India, long-term contract enforcement is still a hurdle,"" says Mr Srivastava. He also points out that agrivoltaics systems are more expensive than a traditional ground-mounted solar farm, so making a return on the investment is more challenging. ""If the farmer starts charging too much for land and the developer has to bear high structural costs, then it becomes unviable,"" he says. At the moment India is falling behind China, where more than 500 projects are in operation, according to the World Resources Institute. ""It's a small beginning. But if the farmer's economic interest is protected, if the right crops are chosen, and if contracts are clear and fair, there's no reason India can not lead in agrivoltaics,"" says Mr Srivastava. Anand Jain Anand Jain has been growing strawberries and tomatoes under solar panels","Agrivoltaics, the practice of farming beneath elevated solar panels, shows promise as a transformative model, particularly in India. Farmers like Harpal Dagar, who partnered with Sun Master five years ago, have seen their income triple and stress from unpredictable weather significantly reduced. Under a 25-year agreement, Dagar receives annual payments and additional income for panel maintenance, while retaining rights to cultivate and sell crops like turmeric on the same land. This innovative approach offers a stable income source, reducing reliance on India's often unpredictable monsoons and shielding crops from heat stress.

Despite the clear benefits, including reduced irrigation needs and diversified revenue streams, the adoption of agrivoltaics in India has been slow, with only around 40 projects currently operational, compared to over 500 in China. Several challenges hinder its widespread implementation. Not all crops are suitable, with high-value, moderate-to-low light needs crops like leafy green vegetables performing best, as panels reduce light by 15-30%. The elevated structure required for farming beneath makes installation 20-30% more expensive than traditional solar farms, making it difficult for small farmers who lack the capital and risk appetite.

Contractual issues are another significant hurdle, as 25-year leases require clear obligations and robust enforcement, which remains a challenge in India. If land charges become too high for farmers and structural costs for developers remain elevated, project viability is threatened.

Companies like SunSeed are working to mitigate these risks by offering models where they absorb crop failure and market risks, and by developing sophisticated simulation software to optimize panel configurations and crop types. They also advocate for government subsidies to make agrivoltaics more attractive. Experts believe that with proper protection for farmers' economic interests, selection of suitable crops, and clear, fair contracts, India has the potential to become a leader in agrivoltaics, enhancing climate adaptation and farmer resilience.","यहां अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

**एग्रीवोल्टेक्स: भारत के लिए एक परिवर्तनकारी कृषि मॉडल**

एग्रीवोल्टेक्स, जिसमें ऊंचे सौर पैनलों के नीचे खेती की जाती है, भारत में एक परिवर्तनकारी मॉडल के रूप में काफी संभावनाएं दिखा रहा है। हरपाल डागर जैसे किसान, जिन्होंने पाँच साल पहले सन मास्टर के साथ साझेदारी की थी, अपनी आय तिगुनी होते और अप्रत्याशित मौसम से होने वाला तनाव काफी कम होते देखा है। 25 साल के समझौते के तहत, डागर को वार्षिक भुगतान और पैनलों के रखरखाव के लिए अतिरिक्त आय मिलती है, जबकि वह उसी ज़मीन पर हल्दी जैसी फसलें उगाने और बेचने का अधिकार बरकरार रखते हैं। यह अभिनव तरीका आय का एक स्थिर स्रोत प्रदान करता है, जिससे भारत के अक्सर अप्रत्याशित मानसून पर निर्भरता कम होती है और फसलों को गर्मी के तनाव से बचाया जा सकता है।

सिंचाई की कम आवश्यकता और राजस्व के विविध स्रोतों सहित स्पष्ट लाभों के बावजूद, भारत में एग्रीवोल्टेक्स को अपनाने की गति धीमी रही है, वर्तमान में चीन में 500 से अधिक परियोजनाओं की तुलना में केवल लगभग 40 परियोजनाएं ही चालू हैं। इसके व्यापक कार्यान्वयन में कई चुनौतियां बाधा डाल रही हैं। सभी फसलें उपयुक्त नहीं हैं; पत्तेदार हरी सब्जियों जैसी उच्च-मूल्य वाली, मध्यम से कम प्रकाश की आवश्यकता वाली फसलें सबसे अच्छा प्रदर्शन करती हैं, क्योंकि पैनल 15-30% तक प्रकाश कम कर देते हैं। नीचे खेती के लिए आवश्यक ऊंची संरचना पारंपरिक सौर फार्मों की तुलना में स्थापना को 20-30% अधिक महंगा बनाती है, जिससे उन छोटे किसानों के लिए यह मुश्किल हो जाता है जिनके पास पूंजी और जोखिम लेने की क्षमता नहीं होती।

अनुबंध संबंधी मुद्दे एक और महत्वपूर्ण बाधा हैं, क्योंकि 25 साल के पट्टों के लिए स्पष्ट दायित्व और मजबूत प्रवर्तन की आवश्यकता होती है, जो भारत में एक चुनौती बनी हुई है। यदि किसानों के लिए भूमि शुल्क बहुत अधिक हो जाता है और डेवलपर्स के लिए संरचनात्मक लागतें अधिक बनी रहती हैं, तो परियोजना की व्यवहार्यता खतरे में पड़ जाती है।

सनसीड जैसी कंपनियां इन जोखिमों को कम करने के लिए काम कर रही हैं, वे ऐसे मॉडल पेश करती हैं जहां वे फसल खराब होने और बाजार के जोखिमों को खुद वहन करती हैं, साथ ही पैनल कॉन्फ़िगरेशन और फसल के प्रकारों को अनुकूलित करने के लिए परिष्कृत सिमुलेशन सॉफ्टवेयर भी विकसित कर रही हैं। वे एग्रीवोल्टेक्स को अधिक आकर्षक बनाने के लिए सरकारी सब्सिडी की भी वकालत करते हैं। विशेषज्ञों का मानना है कि किसानों के आर्थिक हितों की उचित सुरक्षा, उपयुक्त फसलों का चयन और स्पष्ट, निष्पक्ष अनुबंधों के साथ, भारत में एग्रीवोल्टेक्स में अग्रणी बनने की क्षमता है, जिससे जलवायु अनुकूलन और किसानों का लचीलापन बढ़ेगा।",en,[],,"Farming under solar panels is still in the early stages in India, but will it catch on?",[''],www.bbc.com/business,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Production halted at the plants in Solihull, Halewood and Wolverhampton with workers sent home following the hack, which came to light on 1 September. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has said its UK factories will remain closed until next week after the carmaker was hit by a cyber attack at the end of last month. Following the cyber attack, JLR shut down its IT networks in order to protect them from damage. However, because modern factories and parts supply networks are highly automated, this meant the manufacturer had to shut down its production lines. Dealerships were left unable to sell cars at what is usually one of the busiest periods of the year, and garages which service JLR vehicles initially struggled to obtain the parts they needed. Workarounds have since been introduced, which have improved the situation but disruption is continuing. JLR's suppliers have also been badly affected. On Wednesday, the company, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, admitted data might have been stolen or viewed by third parties in the hack. In a statement, the carmaker said: ""As a result of our ongoing investigation, we now believe that some data has been affected, and we are informing the relevant regulators. ""Our forensic investigation continues at pace, and we will contact anyone as appropriate if we find that their data has been impacted."" A group calling itself Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, which was behind cyber attacks on UK retailers including M&S earlier this year, has claimed responsibility for the JLR hack. M&S's operations were affected for a number of months, stopping customers from ordering online and costing the High Street retailer £300m. Last week, the Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC that JLR had reported an incident to the UK's data watchdog. Business minister Chris Bryant met JLR's chief executive Adrian Mardell on Thursday morning and the Department of Business and Trade has said it is speaking to the company on a daily basis. On Tuesday, Bryant told MPs that the National Cyber Security Centre, part of the intelligence agency GCHQ, had been working with JLR since the early stages of the incident.

जैगुआर लैंड रोवर (जेएलआर) ने 1 सितंबर को सामने आए एक साइबर हमले के बाद यूके में अपने कारखानों की बंदी को अगले सप्ताह तक के लिए बढ़ा दिया है। सोलिहुल, हेल्वूड और वोल्वरहैम्प्टन स्थित संयंत्रों को प्रभावित करने वाली इस लंबी बंदी के कारण दो पूरे सप्ताह से अधिक के वैश्विक उत्पादन का नुकसान होगा, जो 14,000 से अधिक कारों के बराबर है।

कार निर्माता कंपनी ने शुरुआत में अपने आईटी नेटवर्क को सुरक्षित रखने के लिए बंद कर दिया था, जिसके बाद अत्यधिक स्वचालित उत्पादन लाइनों को बंद करने के लिए मजबूर होना पड़ा और हजारों श्रमिकों को घर भेजना पड़ा। इस घटना से डीलरशिप गंभीर रूप से बाधित हुए हैं, एक महत्वपूर्ण अवधि के दौरान कार बिक्री को रोका गया है, और सर्विस गैरेज के लिए पुर्जे प्राप्त करने में कठिनाइयाँ पैदा हुई हैं, हालांकि तब से कुछ वैकल्पिक समाधान पेश किए गए हैं। जेएलआर के आपूर्तिकर्ता भी काफी प्रभावित हुए हैं।

बुधवार को, भारत की टाटा मोटर्स के स्वामित्व वाली जेएलआर ने स्वीकार किया कि हैक के दौरान कुछ डेटा चोरी हो गया होगा या तीसरे पक्ष द्वारा देखा गया होगा। कंपनी एक फॉरेंसिक जांच कर रही है, संबंधित नियामकों को सूचित किया है, और उन व्यक्तियों से संपर्क करने का संकल्प लेती है जिनका डेटा प्रभावित पाया जाता है।

Nasa then confirmed this, saying Chinese nationals would be restricted from using the agency's ""facilities, materials and networks to ensure the security of our work"". Chinese nationals, who could only work at Nasa as contractors or students contributing to research, found out on 5 September that they had lost all access to Nasa's systems and facilities, Bloomberg reported, citing sources. US space agency Nasa has blocked Chinese citizens with valid US visas from its facilities - a move that effectively bars them from working at one of the most respected space research centres. Chinese astronauts are already excluded from the International Space Station (ISS) because Washington has barred Nasa from sharing its data with China. The latest restriction from Nasa only adds to the decline in scientific collaboration between the two sides because of national security concerns. As they compete to gain a technological edge, Beijing and Washington have also grown increasingly wary of each other. The suspicion has made it harder for some Chinese students, especially those studying science and tech, to get visas or even enter the US once they have secured a visa. There have also been several cases in the US recently of alleged espionage by Chinese nationals, and scientists in particular have increasingly come under the microscope. It is unclear how much notice Nasa gave Chinese nationals who were working for the agency. Bloomberg reported that they had suddenly found they were denied access to the agency's data systems and were barred from participating in meetings relating to their work - both in-person and virtual. Nasa's press secretary Bethany Stevens told reporters that Nasa had indeed taken ""internal action pertaining to Chinese nationals - including restricting physical and cybersecurity access to our facilities"". China has made no secret of its space ambitions, with both Beijing and Washington competing to send their crews to the moon. ""We're in a second space race right now,"" Nasa's acting administrator Sean Duffy told reporters in a news conference on Wednesday, where he spoke about US discoveries on Mars. ""The Chinese want to get back to the moon before us. That's not going to happen."" The director of the general technology bureau of China's Manned Space Agency last year said US concerns were ""unnecessary"", calling China's space exploration a ""collective mission for humanity"". At a US Senate hearing last week, lawmakers stressed the need for the US to put its boots on the moon before China. ""China has made no secret of its goals,"" said Republican Senator Ted Cruz. ""[If] our adversaries achieve dominant space capabilities, it would pose a profound risk to America... [The] stakes could not be higher."" The race is not just about getting to the Moon, but also who can control its resources once they are there. The Moon contains minerals, including rare earths metals like iron and titanium - and helium too, which is used in everything from superconductors to medical equipment.","The US space agency Nasa has implemented significant new restrictions on Chinese nationals, effectively banning them from accessing its facilities, materials, and networks. This move, which resulted in a sudden denial of access for many Chinese contractors and students on September 5th, stems from mounting national security concerns and a perceived ""second space race"" with China.

Nasa confirmed these ""internal actions,"" stating they were necessary ""to ensure the security of our work."" This decision exacerbates an existing decline in scientific collaboration between the two nations, which already excludes Chinese astronauts from the International Space Station (ISS) due to US prohibitions on data sharing.

The intensified rivalry is fueled by China's rapidly accelerating space program, its ambition to land crews on the Moon before the US, and a broader atmosphere of suspicion, including recent allegations of espionage by Chinese nationals. Nasa's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, emphasized the critical competition, asserting that the US will not allow China to reach the Moon first. US lawmakers, like Senator Ted Cruz, have echoed these concerns, stressing the need for the US to secure a dominant position in space to avoid ""profound risk.""

The competition extends beyond just reaching the Moon to controlling its valuable resources, such as rare earth metals and helium. While China's Manned Space Agency has dismissed US concerns as ""unnecessary"" and framed its space exploration as a ""collective mission for humanity,"" the US remains resolute in its efforts to gain a technological and strategic edge. The heightened scrutiny has also made it more challenging for Chinese science and technology students to obtain US visas.","**नासा ने चीनी नागरिकों पर लगाए कड़े प्रतिबंध, राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा और 'अंतरिक्ष दौड़' का हवाला**

नासा ने इन ""आंतरिक कार्रवाइयों"" की पुष्टि करते हुए कहा कि ""हमारे काम की सुरक्षा सुनिश्चित करने के लिए"" ये आवश्यक थीं। यह निर्णय दोनों देशों के बीच वैज्ञानिक सहयोग में मौजूदा गिरावट को और बढ़ा देता है, जिसमें डेटा साझाकरण पर अमेरिकी प्रतिबंधों के कारण चीनी अंतरिक्ष यात्री पहले से ही अंतर्राष्ट्रीय अंतरिक्ष स्टेशन (ISS) से बाहर हैं।

चीन के तेजी से बढ़ते अंतरिक्ष कार्यक्रम, अमेरिका से पहले चंद्रमा पर दल उतारने की उसकी महत्वाकांक्षा, और संदेह के एक व्यापक माहौल, जिसमें चीनी नागरिकों द्वारा जासूसी के हालिया आरोप भी शामिल हैं, ने इस तेज हुई प्रतिद्वंद्विता को और हवा दी है। नासा के कार्यवाहक प्रशासक सीन डफी ने इस महत्वपूर्ण प्रतिस्पर्धा पर जोर देते हुए दृढ़ता से कहा कि अमेरिका चीन को चंद्रमा पर पहले पहुँचने नहीं देगा। सीनेटर टेड क्रूज़ जैसे अमेरिकी सांसदों ने भी इन चिंताओं को दोहराया है, और ""गहरे जोखिम"" से बचने के लिए अमेरिका को अंतरिक्ष में एक प्रमुख स्थान सुरक्षित करने की आवश्यकता पर बल दिया है।

यह प्रतिस्पर्धा केवल चंद्रमा पर पहुँचने तक ही सीमित नहीं है, बल्कि उसके मूल्यवान संसाधनों, जैसे दुर्लभ पृथ्वी धातुओं और हीलियम को नियंत्रित करने तक भी फैली हुई है। जबकि चीन की मानवयुक्त अंतरिक्ष एजेंसी ने अमेरिकी चिंताओं को ""अनावश्यक"" बताकर खारिज कर दिया है और अपने अंतरिक्ष अन्वेषण को ""मानवता के लिए एक सामूहिक मिशन"" के रूप में प्रस्तुत किया है, अमेरिका एक तकनीकी और रणनीतिक बढ़त हासिल करने के अपने प्रयासों में दृढ़ बना हुआ है। इस बढ़ी हुई जाँच ने चीनी विज्ञान और प्रौद्योगिकी छात्रों के लिए अमेरिकी वीज़ा प्राप्त करना भी और अधिक चुनौतीपूर्ण बना दिया है।",en,[],,"Earlier this month, Chinese nationals working with Nasa suddenly found themselves denied access.",[''],www.bbc.com/business,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

John Lewis Partnership chair Jason Tarry, said there was ""no doubt that consumer confidence is subdued"" ahead of the Budget in November. The employee-owned company, whose shops include the John Lewis department stores and Waitrose, said losses before tax and exceptional costs increased to £88m from £30m a year earlier. John Lewis has said its losses nearly tripled in the first half of the year, fuelled by the new cost of dealing with waste packaging and increased National Insurance Contributions (NICs). John Lewis Partnership said it spent £29m on a combination of the new Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policy - where waste packaging costs have shifted from local government to retailers and producers - as well as higher NICs. It also incurred costs on a long-running programme to turn the business around. The Bank of England has previously said that the EPR levy could add up to 0.5% to food prices if retailers pass the full cost onto customers. The £29m cost in the six months to 26 July was roughly equally split between the packaging levy and employer National Insurance payments. Last year, John Lewis was one of a number of British retailers that warned prices would rises and there would be ""inevitable"" job losses because of measures announced in last year's Budget which included the change to NICs. Commenting on the outlook for the economy and the upcoming Budget, Mr Tarry said: ""There's no doubt consumer confidence is subdued. ""We'll focus on what we can control."" He is predicting that strong sales in the second half of the financial year, particularly in the run up to Christmas, will allow the company to post a profit in its full-year results.

He added that the company expects strong sales for Christmas gifts such as wearable tech and Jellycat soft toys. Waitrose sales rose by 6% to £4.1bn, and Mr Tarry said he expected customers would want to treat themselves over the festive period. Total revenue across the partnership increased by 4% to £6.2bn. Mr Tarry said that John Lewis was committed to paying its staff bonus ""as soon as we possibly can"" but it was ""far too early in the year"" to say when that would happen. Staff at John Lewis have not received a bonus in three years. John Lewis has made efforts in the past few years to win back customers after the pandemic and increased competition from other retailers. It brought back its Never Knowingly Undersold price promise last year, two years after abandoning it. Commenting on the company's results, Zoe Mills, lead analyst at GlobalData, said this allowed the company to secure a ""competitive edge"". She added that John Lewis could continue to attract customers by offering staff with good knowledge of their products who can offer trustworthy advice and recommendations in areas like electronics and make-up.","The John Lewis Partnership saw its first-half losses nearly triple to £88m, up from £30m a year earlier, primarily due to new costs from the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policy for waste packaging and increased National Insurance Contributions (NICs), totaling £29m. Additional expenses were incurred from a long-running business turnaround program.

Despite this, the employee-owned company, which includes John Lewis department stores and Waitrose supermarkets, anticipates returning to profit for the full financial year, relying on strong sales during the crucial second-half Christmas trading period. Chairman Jason Tarry acknowledged ""subdued"" consumer confidence ahead of November's Budget but expressed optimism for festive sales, particularly for items like wearable tech and soft toys.

Waitrose sales rose by 6% to £4.1bn, contributing to an overall partnership revenue increase of 4% to £6.2bn. The company reaffirmed its commitment to paying staff bonuses, though it's ""far too early in the year"" to confirm details, noting that staff have not received a bonus in three years. John Lewis has also been working to regain customers, including reinstating its ""Never Knowingly Undersold"" price promise, which an analyst believes, alongside knowledgeable staff, provides a ""competitive edge.""","यहाँ अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

**जॉन लुईस पार्टनरशिप को हुए नुकसान में वृद्धि, त्योहारी बिक्री से वापसी की उम्मीद**

जॉन लुईस पार्टनरशिप को पहली छमाही में हुए नुकसान में लगभग तीन गुना वृद्धि देखने को मिली, जो पिछले साल के 3 करोड़ पाउंड से बढ़कर 8.8 करोड़ पाउंड हो गया। इसका मुख्य कारण कचरा पैकेजिंग के लिए विस्तारित उत्पादक उत्तरदायित्व (ईपीआर) नीति से जुड़ी नई लागतें और बढ़े हुए राष्ट्रीय बीमा योगदान (एनआईसी) रहे, जिनकी कुल राशि 2.9 करोड़ पाउंड थी। इसके अलावा, लंबे समय से चल रहे एक व्यवसाय सुधार कार्यक्रम से भी अतिरिक्त खर्च हुए।

इसके बावजूद, यह कर्मचारी-स्वामित्व वाली कंपनी, जिसमें जॉन लुईस डिपार्टमेंट स्टोर और वेट्रोज़ सुपरमार्केट शामिल हैं, पूरे वित्तीय वर्ष के लिए लाभ में लौटने की उम्मीद कर रही है, जो कि महत्वपूर्ण दूसरी छमाही के क्रिसमस व्यापार अवधि के दौरान मजबूत बिक्री पर निर्भर है। अध्यक्ष जेसन टैरी ने नवंबर के बजट से पहले 'मंद' उपभोक्ता विश्वास को स्वीकार किया, लेकिन त्योहारी बिक्री के लिए आशावाद व्यक्त किया, खासकर वियरेबल टेक और सॉफ्ट टॉयज़ जैसी वस्तुओं के लिए।

वेट्रोज़ की बिक्री 6% बढ़कर 4.1 अरब पाउंड हो गई, जिसने कुल पार्टनरशिप राजस्व में 4% की वृद्धि दर्ज करने में योगदान दिया, जो 6.2 अरब पाउंड तक पहुंच गया। कंपनी ने कर्मचारियों को बोनस देने की अपनी प्रतिबद्धता दोहराई, हालांकि उसने यह भी कहा कि विवरण की पुष्टि के लिए अभी 'साल की शुरुआत' है। उसने यह भी बताया कि कर्मचारियों को तीन साल से बोनस नहीं मिला है। जॉन लुईस ग्राहकों को फिर से हासिल करने के लिए भी काम कर रहा है, जिसमें अपनी 'नेवर नोइंगली अंडरसोल्ड' मूल्य प्रतिज्ञा को फिर से लागू करना शामिल है। एक विश्लेषक का मानना है कि यह प्रतिज्ञा, जानकार कर्मचारियों के साथ मिलकर, एक 'प्रतिस्पर्धात्मक बढ़त' प्रदान करती है।",en,[],,The owner of the eponymous department store and Waitrose expects the business to return to profit.,[''],www.bbc.com/business,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Until just a few years ago, the Turks and Caicos Islands were known predominantly as a luxury Caribbean tourist destination. The startling beauty of the archipelago has regularly earned it ""world's best beach"" titles, and thrust it onto the bucket lists of the globe's most affluent travellers. But alarming levels of violent crime have rocked the once sleepy British Overseas Territory, earning it accolades it welcomes far less. Last year it recorded 48 homicides, which, given its population is less than 50,000, gave it the worst murder rate per capita in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to one study. This year the territory had already recorded 24 killings up to mid-August, heightened by the first mass shooting in its history in July, which left four dead and nine injured. ""People are very afraid,"" Jacques, a church pastor who lives on the main island of Providenciales, tells the BBC. ""Some are even leaving. We all love the islands, the economy is good, but the crime environment is terrible."" With record-breaking numbers of holidaymakers – almost two million – visiting Turks and Caicos in 2024, the crime does not yet appear to be affecting tourism. But there are fears that unless efforts to curtail it prove successful, crime could threaten its mainstay, estimated to account for at least two-thirds of the economy. Some, including the islands' Premier Washington Misick, have been quick to blame migrants from Haiti, which lies just 90 miles to the south. They flee to Turks and Caicos to escape gang-led turmoil and violence back home. ""The crime situation is worse in the Haitian communities [on Turks and Caicos],"" concedes Jacques, who was born in Haiti, and moved to Turks and Caicos where he gained citizenship 28 years ago. Most of those slain this year are of Haitian nationality, he says. Jacques and his young family were themselves victims of an armed robbery last December. ""We were held at gunpoint by a guy who entered the country illegally on a boat. I am just one example,"" he adds. Premier Misick dubbed July's mass shooting in a local bar a ""gangland-type slaying"", and appealed to Haitian community leaders to help ""keep these islands safe"". ""You know who these violent criminals are, you know how guns are getting into the country,"" he charged. A statement from the Haitian Heritage Association called for a ""united front"" in stemming the scourge - and lamented ""hateful narratives"" levelled at Haitian people by some members of the Turks and Caicos public. Some believe the territory's complex citizenship laws have inadvertently created a crucible of disenfranchised Haitian youngsters. Children born in Turks and Caicos struggle to acquire legal status if neither parent has such. As the government grapples to arrest a surging tide of Haitian migrants entering the country illegally by boat, deportation efforts have been stepped up. ""They're picking [Haitian] people up on every corner, every street, on the road, at workplaces,"" Jacques says. ""Most of the time the parents want the kids to remain here, rather than go to Haiti [with them], where it's chaos. So they stay with friends, family, church members."" ""A lot of kids fall through the cracks,"" adds Jacques. ""They turn 18 and try to get a work permit as if they were a foreigner. Often they're turned down even for those."" The country's proximity to Haiti is ""both a blessing and a curse"", he believes. ""They need migrant workers to keep up with development, but Haiti's violence is spilling over to Turks and Caicos."" Recently implemented anti-crime efforts include temporary curfews, tighter controls on establishments selling alcohol, and increased search powers for police. Meanwhile, a crackdown on informal settlements that police say harbour criminals saw more than 220 shanty homes bulldozed in August. Tourism provides the bulk of Turks and Caicos' revenues, bringing in $250m (£186m) during the first half of the 2024-2025 financial year. But while the country has seen rapid development over the past two decades, not everyone has reaped its benefits, says local reporter Wilkie Arthur. ""Many people don't even want to be in gangs, they just can't find work. We need to empower them so they won't have to rob someone for a couple of dollars,"" he says. ""A lot of gang members have legal status here, and there's also a number of local boys involved. Blaming it all on Haitians is not a good representation of the truth."" Wilkie knows all too well the plight of young men existing on the margins of society. An ex-convict himself, he previously served 11 years behind bars for the armed robbery of a jewellery store. Since his release in 2023 he now tries to steer others away from crime. He agrees that too many young people of Haitian origin are finding themselves in legal limbo when they finish school. ""They have no proper documents so the gangs recruit them, feed them so they become loyal to them, and then the gangs just get bigger. ""Every graduating year, a lot of the kids don't have proper documents. Some are very bright and take their education seriously, but what do they do if they want to eat and survive?"" Getty Images Turks and Caicos' visual appeal to holidaymakers is obvious Turks and Caicos is not alone in experiencing an upsurge in gang violence in recent years. A 2024 United Nations report spoke of an ""intensification of organised crime and … lethal violence"" across the Caribbean region. It said surging drug production in South America, which often passes through the Caribbean on its way to the US and Europe, and the high availability of firearms, had ""contributed to soaring homicide rates"". It named Jamaica, St Lucia and Trinidad as particular areas for concern. Yet the report added that ""only a handful of the hundreds of gangs"" in the Caribbean were active in trafficking drugs and guns to the US and elsewhere. Instead it said ""most gangs in the Caribbean"" were ""typically parochial, and focused instead on protecting their territory"". It added that the gangs were more often involved in local drug dealing, prostitution, scams, extortion, disrupting elections and securing government contracts. Wilkie Arthur Wilkie Arthur served 11 years in prison and now tries to steer others away from crime","The Turks and Caicos Islands, once a serene luxury tourist destination, are now grappling with an escalating violent crime crisis, recording the highest per capita murder rate in Latin America last year with 48 homicides. Residents, like Pastor Jacques Phanor, express profound fear, with some even leaving the territory following a surge in fatal shootings, including its first mass shooting in July.

While the islands' vital tourism industry remains robust, there are significant fears that unchecked crime could soon jeopardize this economic mainstay. Premier Washington Misick has largely attributed the rise in violence to migrants from Haiti, citing the high number of Haitian nationals among the victims and appealing to Haitian community leaders for assistance.

However, the situation is complex. Critics, including the Haitian Heritage Association and local reporter Wilkie Arthur (a former convict now working to deter youth from crime), highlight how the territory's intricate citizenship laws create a class of disenfranchised Haitian-born youth who, lacking legal status and opportunities, become vulnerable to gang recruitment. Aggressive deportation efforts, though aimed at illegal migration, inadvertently exacerbate this issue by separating families and leaving unsupported children. Arthur also points out that a significant number of local youth and those with legal status are involved in gangs, often driven by a lack of economic opportunity despite the islands' rapid development.

The crime surge in Turks and Caicos reflects a wider regional problem, with a 2024 UN report noting an ""intensification of organised crime and lethal violence"" across the Caribbean, partly fueled by increasing drug production in South America. In response, TCI authorities have implemented strict anti-crime measures, including temporary curfews, tighter alcohol controls, increased police powers, and the demolition of informal settlements. The core challenge for the islands remains balancing the need for migrant workers with controlling violence, and effectively integrating and empowering all youth to prevent them from falling into crime.","तुर्क एंड कैकोस द्वीप समूह, जो कभी एक शांत विलासिता वाला पर्यटन स्थल था, अब एक बढ़ते हिंसक अपराध संकट से जूझ रहा है। पिछले साल लैटिन अमेरिका में इसकी प्रति व्यक्ति हत्या दर सबसे अधिक रही, जहाँ 48 हत्याएँ हुईं। पादरी जैक्स फनोर जैसे निवासी गहरा डर व्यक्त करते हैं, कुछ लोग तो जुलाई में अपनी पहली सामूहिक गोलीबारी सहित घातक गोलीबारी में वृद्धि के बाद क्षेत्र छोड़ भी रहे हैं।

हालांकि द्वीप समूह का महत्वपूर्ण पर्यटन उद्योग मजबूत बना हुआ है, फिर भी गंभीर आशंकाएं हैं कि अनियंत्रित अपराध जल्द ही इस आर्थिक आधार को खतरे में डाल सकता है। प्रीमियर वाशिंगटन मिसिक ने हिंसा में वृद्धि का श्रेय बड़े पैमाने पर हैती के प्रवासियों को दिया है, पीड़ितों में हैती के नागरिकों की उच्च संख्या का हवाला देते हुए सहायता के लिए हैती समुदाय के नेताओं से अपील की है।

हालांकि, स्थिति जटिल है। हैती हेरिटेज एसोसिएशन और स्थानीय रिपोर्टर विल्की आर्थर (एक पूर्व अपराधी जो अब युवाओं को अपराध से दूर रखने का काम कर रहा है) सहित आलोचकों ने इस बात पर प्रकाश डाला है कि क्षेत्र के जटिल नागरिकता कानून हैती में जन्मे युवाओं का एक वंचित वर्ग कैसे बनाते हैं, जिनके पास कानूनी दर्जा और अवसर न होने के कारण वे गिरोहों में भर्ती होने के प्रति संवेदनशील हो जाते हैं। आक्रामक निर्वासन के प्रयास, हालांकि अवैध प्रवासन को लक्षित करते हैं, अनजाने में परिवारों को अलग करके और बच्चों को बिना सहारे के छोड़कर इस मुद्दे को और बढ़ा देते हैं। आर्थर यह भी बताते हैं कि बड़ी संख्या में स्थानीय युवा और कानूनी दर्जा वाले लोग भी गिरोहों में शामिल हैं, जो अक्सर द्वीप समूह के तेजी से विकास के बावजूद आर्थिक अवसरों की कमी से प्रेरित होते हैं।

तुर्क एंड कैकोस में अपराध में वृद्धि एक व्यापक क्षेत्रीय समस्या को दर्शाती है, जिसमें 2024 की संयुक्त राष्ट्र की एक रिपोर्ट में कैरिबियन में ""संगठित अपराध और घातक हिंसा के बढ़ने"" का उल्लेख किया गया है, जिसका आंशिक कारण दक्षिण अमेरिका में बढ़ती मादक पदार्थों का उत्पादन है। जवाब में, टीसीआई अधिकारियों ने कड़े अपराध-विरोधी उपाय लागू किए हैं, जिनमें अस्थायी कर्फ्यू, शराब पर सख्त नियंत्रण, पुलिस शक्तियों में वृद्धि और अनौपचारिक बस्तियों का विध्वंस शामिल है। द्वीप समूह के लिए मुख्य चुनौती प्रवासी श्रमिकों की आवश्यकता और हिंसा को नियंत्रित करने के बीच संतुलन बनाना, साथ ही सभी युवाओं को अपराध में पड़ने से रोकने के लिए उन्हें प्रभावी ढंग से एकीकृत और सशक्त बनाना है।",en,[],,"Turks and Caicos Islands, a popular high-end tourist destination, is beset with violent crime.",[''],www.bbc.com/business,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

**नोवो नॉर्डिस्क 9,000 कर्मचारियों की छंटनी करेगी, लागत में कटौती और प्रतिस्पर्धा के दबाव का सामना**

डेनिश फार्मास्युटिकल कंपनी और लोकप्रिय वज़न घटाने वाली दवाएँ ओज़ेम्पिक (Ozempic) तथा वेगोवी (Wegovy) की निर्माता नोवो नॉर्डिस्क (Novo Nordisk) ने घोषणा की है कि वह 9,000 कर्मचारियों की छंटनी करेगी, जो उसके वैश्विक कार्यबल का 11% है। यह निर्णय कंपनी ने अगले साल के अंत तक 92.7 करोड़ पाउंड (8 अरब डेनिश क्रोनर) की लागत में कटौती करने के लक्ष्य के साथ लिया है, जिसका कारण कड़ी प्रतिस्पर्धा और लगातार विकसित हो रहा वज़न घटाने वाला बाज़ार है।

सीईओ श्री दोस्तदार ने कहा कि कंपनी को बदलती बाज़ार गतिशीलता, विशेष रूप से मोटापे के क्षेत्र में अनुकूल ढलने के लिए ""बदलना होगा""। ये छंटनी जुलाई में दी गई एक चेतावनी के बाद हुई हैं, जिसमें कहा गया था कि नोवो नॉर्डिस्क की पूरे साल की बिक्री और मुनाफ़ा उम्मीद के मुताबिक तेज़ी से नहीं बढ़ेगा। इसके पीछे 'नकली' वज़न घटाने वाली दवाओं का बाज़ार में आना और तेज़ी से विस्तार के कारण बढ़ी हुई संगठनात्मक जटिलता को कारण बताया गया था।

कंपनी को मौनजारो (Mounjaro) दवा की निर्माता एली लिली (Eli Lilly) जैसी प्रतिद्वंद्वी कंपनियों से भारी दबाव का सामना करना पड़ रहा है। एली लिली ने हाल ही में यूके में मौनजारो की उच्चतम मासिक खुराक की कीमत 122 पाउंड से 330 पाउंड तक, यानी 170% तक बढ़ाकर विवाद खड़ा कर दिया था। कंपनी ने इसका कारण उच्च यूरोपीय और अमेरिकी कीमतों के साथ तालमेल बिठाना बताया था। हालांकि, एली लिली ने उपभोक्ताओं पर पड़ने वाले प्रभाव को कम करने के लिए यूके के आपूर्तिकर्ताओं को रियायती सौदे दिए हैं, फिर भी यह घटना बाज़ार की अस्थिर और अत्यधिक प्रतिस्पर्धी प्रकृति को उजागर करती है।

श्री दोस्तदार ने इन छंटनियों की कठिनाई को स्वीकार किया, लेकिन इस बात पर जोर दिया कि ये ""सही निर्णय"" हैं। नोवो नॉर्डिस्क आने वाले महीनों में कर्मचारियों के साथ चर्चा शुरू करने की योजना बना रही है और 5 नवंबर को आगे के वित्तीय विवरण जारी करेगी।",en,[],,"The Danish firm, which also produces Wegovy, has warned of increased pressure from ""knock-off"" drugs.",[''],www.bbc.com/business,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The multi-national business, known as MSD in Europe, said it would move its life sciences research to the US and cut UK jobs, blaming successive governments for undervaluing innovative medicines. One science industry expert told the BBC that, following Merck's decision, many major pharmaceutical companies could stop investing in the UK. A spokesperson for the government defended its investments in science and research, but acknowledged there was ""more work to do"". Pharmaceutical companies have been refocusing on investing in the US following pressure from President Donald Trump, including threats of sky-high tariffs on drug imports. Merck had already begun construction on a site in London's King's Cross which was due to be completed by 2027, but said it no longer planned to occupy it. The company will also vacate its laboratories in the London Bioscience Innovation Centre and the Francis Crick Institute by the end of the year, which will lead to 125 job losses. A spokesperson for the drug company said the decision ""reflects the challenges of the UK not making meaningful progress towards addressing the lack of investment in the life science industry and the overall undervaluation of innovative medicines and vaccines by successive UK governments"". 'Global uncertainty' Speaking in the House of Commons, science minister Ian Murray said Merck's decision was ""deeply disappointing"" but that it was ""a commercial decision for them"". The company recently announced 6,000 job losses and $3bn (£2.2bn) per year cost cuts. Mr Murray said global economic pressures and the US trade policy had compounded its problems. He added that pharmaceutical companies were getting a lower proportion of NHS drugs spending due to the actions of previous Conservative and coalition governments. However, Conservative shadow science secretary Julia Lopez said the message from Merck bosses was ""unsparing"". ""Simply put, the UK is not internationally competitive"", she said. ""The government must wake up, and do so now."" Drugs spending Sir John Bell, emeritus regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, told the BBC's Today programme that he'd spoken to several bosses of major companies in the past six months, ""and they're all in the same space, and that is, they're not going to do any more investing in the UK"". One of the problems, he said, was the amount of money the NHS spends on medicines. ""Ten years ago, we used to spend 15% of our healthcare spend on pharmaceuticals. Now it's 9%. The rest of the world, the OECD, are sitting between 14 and 20%,"" Sir John said. ""The large companies do have to work in a system where they can sell their products, and if they can't sell their products here, they'll go and do their business somewhere else."" Richard Torbett, head of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said the decision was ""an incredible blow"". ""We've really got to see it as a wake up call to try and understand what is driving companies to make these difficult decisions and what can we do to turn that round,"" he told the BBC's Wake Up To Money programme. ""The lack of competitiveness of the UK is the big thing that's driven the decision,"" he added. ""We've got systematic under-investment in the products that come out of the end of innovation."" MSD is the latest pharmaceutical company to abandon or reduce investment plans in the UK. In January, AstraZeneca walked away from plans to invest £450m in expanding a vaccine manufacturing plant in Merseyside earlier this year, blaming reduced government support. The UK boss of another pharmaceutical giant warned last month that NHS patients would lose access to cutting-edged treatments because Britain was ""largely uninvestable"". Norvartis's Johan Kahlstrom said the company had ""already been unable to launch several medicines"" in the country due to the ""declining competitiveness"" of the UK market. In 2023, AstraZeneca chose to build a new factory in the Republic of Ireland instead of the UK. The firm's boss said at the time it wanted to build the site in north-west England, but a ""discouraging"" tax rate meant it chose Dublin instead. Industry sources told the BBC the sector had been attracting major funding in the hub around Kings Cross focused on the intersection between life sciences and AI. They pushed back on claims that the decision was linked to ongoing negotiations over drug prices, in which industry has been lobbying hard for the NHS to approve more and pay more for medicines. The current pricing regime was set and agreed to by drug companies in 2023 - less than 18 months ago. Since then, pharmaceutical firms have come under pressure from the Trump administration to lower drug prices for American customers and to invest more in the US - affecting their ability to invest elsewhere. In an August interview with CNBC, Trump suggested that tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported to the US could reach up to 250%. The threat followed an executive order signed by the president in May aimed at reducing drug prices for American consumers. Dr David Roblin, chief executive of London-based biotechnology company Relation Therapeutics, told the BBC the fundamentals that drove MSD to invest in the UK in the first place had not changed. ""The academic environment in the UK continues to produce innovative ideas and people to run with those ideas, which attracts foreign investment,"" he said. ""The environment to do research is still outstanding: we've got great academics, the NHS does provide a research platform, for example the UK Biobank is proving to be a real attractor for companies like mine,"" he said. What has changed, Dr Roblin said, was the political landscape in the US which big pharma has to respond to, ""because the US remains the largest market for pharmaceuticals on earth,"" he added.","Pharmaceutical giant Merck (known as MSD in Europe) has cancelled its £1 billion UK expansion, moving its life sciences research to the US and cutting 125 jobs. The company blamed successive UK governments for undervaluing innovative medicines and a lack of investment in the life science industry, stating the UK is not internationally competitive.

This move is a significant blow to the UK's drug sector and reflects a broader trend, with other major pharmaceutical companies like AstraZeneca and Novartis also reducing or abandoning UK investment plans, citing declining competitiveness, ""discouraging"" tax rates, and a lower proportion of NHS spending on medicines (9% compared to 14-20% in other OECD countries). Experts warn that this could lead to many major pharmaceutical companies ceasing investment in the UK and NHS patients losing access to cutting-edge treatments.

Compounding these domestic issues, companies are increasingly refocusing investment on the US market due to global economic pressures and President Trump's threats of high tariffs (up to 250%) on imported drugs, making the US the primary market.

While the UK government defended its science and research investments, acknowledging ""more work to do,"" industry leaders have called Merck's decision an ""incredible blow"" and a ""wake-up call."" Despite the immediate challenges, some experts suggest the UK's fundamental academic environment and research platforms remain strong, with the shift primarily driven by the changing political landscape in the US.","यहाँ अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

यह कदम ब्रिटेन के दवा क्षेत्र के लिए एक महत्वपूर्ण झटका है और यह एक व्यापक प्रवृत्ति को दर्शाता है, जिसमें एस्ट्राज़ेनेका और नोवार्टिस जैसी अन्य प्रमुख फार्मास्युटिकल कंपनियाँ भी ब्रिटेन में अपनी निवेश योजनाओं को कम कर रही हैं या छोड़ रही हैं। वे घटती प्रतिस्पर्धात्मकता, ""हतोत्साहित करने वाली"" कर दरों और दवाओं पर NHS के खर्च के कम अनुपात (अन्य OECD देशों में 14-20% की तुलना में 9%) का हवाला दे रही हैं। विशेषज्ञ चेतावनी देते हैं कि इससे कई प्रमुख फार्मास्युटिकल कंपनियाँ ब्रिटेन में निवेश बंद कर सकती हैं और NHS के मरीजों को अत्याधुनिक उपचारों तक पहुँच से वंचित होना पड़ सकता है।

इन घरेलू मुद्दों के अलावा, कंपनियाँ वैश्विक आर्थिक दबावों और राष्ट्रपति ट्रम्प द्वारा आयातित दवाओं पर उच्च शुल्क (250% तक) लगाने की धमकियों के कारण तेजी से अपना निवेश अमेरिकी बाजार पर केंद्रित कर रही हैं, जिससे अमेरिका प्राथमिक बाजार बन गया है।

जहाँ ब्रिटेन सरकार ने अपने विज्ञान और अनुसंधान निवेश का बचाव किया और यह स्वीकार किया कि 'अभी और काम करना बाकी है', वहीं उद्योग के नेताओं ने मर्क के इस फैसले को ""अविश्वसनीय झटका"" और ""वेक-अप कॉल"" (एक चेतावनी) बताया है। इन तत्काल चुनौतियों के बावजूद, कुछ विशेषज्ञों का सुझाव है कि ब्रिटेन का मौलिक शैक्षणिक वातावरण और अनुसंधान मंच मजबूत बने हुए हैं, और यह बदलाव मुख्य रूप से अमेरिका में बदलते राजनीतिक परिदृश्य के कारण हो रहा है।",en,[],,"The firm, known as MSD in Europe, said there has been a lack of investment in life sciences.",[''],www.bbc.com/business,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The deal would mark further consolidation in the US media industry, which has been dramatically reshaped by the rise of streaming, and comes as media firms face scrutiny from President Donald Trump's administration. Warner Brothers Discovery declined to comment. Paramount Skydance did not respond to a request for comment. The potential offer from Paramount Skydance was first reported in the Wall Street Journal.

His father, an ally of Trump, this week briefly overtook Elon Musk as the world's richest person, worth more than $380bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires index. Trump earlier this year floated his name as a potential TikTok buyer. The Paramount takeover plunged his son into politics as well. The deal faced a lengthy approval process due to a row over Trump's legal battle with CBS over a Kamala Harris interview he alleged had been edited to favour the Democratic Party. Paramount eventually agreed to pay $16m to settle the dispute. The money will go to a future presidential library. The settlement did not include a statement of apology or regret. Democrats have called the payment a ""bribe"" - an accusation that Paramount has denied - and demanded documents about the negotiations from the firm. Announcing the approval of the deal, the government said Skydance had committed to ensure its programming would ""embody a diversity of viewpoints"", end Paramount's diversity programmes, and appoint an ombudsman to review complaints of bias. Ahead of the approval, Paramount said the Late Show with Stephen Colbert would end its run in May 2026. The move drew questions from Democrats about whether the cancellation was due to political reasons, which the firm denied. Paramount in July also announced a five-year deal to air the satirical adult cartoon series South Park on its streaming network, poaching the show from HBO.","Shares of Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) surged by 29% following reports that Paramount Skydance is preparing an offer to acquire the entire company.

वार्नर ब्रदर्स डिस्कवरी (WBD) के शेयरों में 29% की तेजी देखी गई, उन रिपोर्टों के बाद कि पैरामाउंट स्काईडांस पूरी कंपनी का अधिग्रहण करने के लिए एक प्रस्ताव तैयार कर रहा है। यह संभावित सौदा, जिसमें WBD की प्रमुख संपत्तियां जैसे CNN, HBO और उसका फिल्म स्टूडियो (जो 'बार्बी' और 'हैरी पॉटर' का घर है) शामिल होंगी, स्ट्रीमिंग द्वारा नाटकीय रूप से बदल दिए गए और ट्रम्प प्रशासन की जांच का सामना कर रहे अमेरिकी मीडिया उद्योग में और समेकन का संकेत देता है। पैरामाउंट स्काईडांस के शेयरों में भी 16% की वृद्धि हुई।

वॉल स्ट्रीट जर्नल, जिसने सबसे पहले संभावित प्रस्ताव की सूचना दी थी, ने चेतावनी दी कि अभी तक औपचारिक रूप से कोई बोली जमा नहीं की गई है और यह योजना अभी भी विफल हो सकती है। वार्नर ब्रदर्स डिस्कवरी और पैरामाउंट स्काईडांस दोनों ने इन रिपोर्टों पर टिप्पणी करने से इनकार कर दिया है।

पैरामाउंट स्काईडांस का नेतृत्व डेविड एलिसन कर रहे हैं, जो ओरेकल के सह-संस्थापक लैरी एलिसन के बेटे हैं, जो ट्रम्प के एक सहयोगी हैं और जो इस सप्ताह संक्षेप में दुनिया के सबसे अमीर आदमी बन गए थे। यह संभावित अधिग्रहण पैरामाउंट स्काईडांस द्वारा अपने $8 बिलियन के विलय को पूरा करने के ठीक कुछ हफ़्तों बाद आया है, जिसमें पैरामाउंट का अधिग्रहण किया गया था, जिसमें CBS न्यूज़ नेटवर्क और 'येलोस्टोन' जैसे हिट शामिल हैं। डेविड एलिसन कथित तौर पर डिजिटल मीडिया आउटलेट द फ्री प्रेस को खरीदने के लिए भी बातचीत कर रहे हैं।

""It makes absolutely zero sense why, now, these facilities are being sited practically in people's backyards, and next to gas stations, all over Staten Island,"" says the city councillor. ""Simply put, it is not just a bad policy, but a dangerous one, and the city is literally playing with fire by allowing this to happen."" Holden is talking about proposals to build more battery energy storage system (Bess) centres - large-scale power storage sites based on the same lithium-ion batteries that are used in laptops and electric cars. The batteries are stored, thousands together, in large metal boxes. Such facilities are increasingly springing up all over the world, with 21.9 gigawatt-hours installed in Europe last year alone, according to industry group SolarPower Europe. That's enough to power some 16 million homes. And there's a need for a great many more. Achieving net zero by 2030 - or getting anywhere near it - requires a massive shift to renewable power sources such as solar and wind. And electricity produced by such renewables can go to waste unless it can be stored and then delivered at a time when it's needed, such as everyone turning on the lights in the evening. And that's where Bess come in. ""For the moment, in the European Union, what we are looking at is that we should increase battery deployments by a factor of 10,"" says Driese Acke, deputy chief executive of SolarPower Europe. While there's currently around 75 gigawatt-hours of battery storage installed in the EU, he says that needs to rise to around 750 by 2030. Robert Dryfe, professor of physical chemistry at the University of Manchester, says there are alternatives to battery storage. These include cryogenic storage, where power from renewables is stored by chilling air into liquid form. When the liquid is then allowed to warm up it expands back into gas and can drive a turbine to make electricity. Then there are long-established hydro power systems, whereby water is released from a higher reservoir to a lower one, also driving turbines. Yet Prof Dryfe describes both cryogenic and hydro as ""fairly niche devices"". ""So really to keep pace with the increasing deployment of renewables it's hard to see beyond electrochemical storage mechanisms,"" he adds. Robert Dryfe Prof Robert Dryfe says more Bess facilities will have to be built However, Bess technology is far from perfect. The biggest issue - and the one concerning protesters the most - is the installations' potential vulnerability to fire. In the UK, a fire at a Bess facility in Essex back in February took almost 24 hours to extinguish. A similar fire in Liverpool in 2020 took 59 hours to put out. And in January of this year, a fire at one of the world's largest Bess plants in northern California led to the evacuation of around 1,500 people and the closure of a major highway. The cause of such blazes is a process called thermal runway. This can be triggered by events from short-circuits to physical damage and manufacturing defects, and which allows heat-producing chemical reactions to start within the battery. This can lead to the release of flammable (and toxic) gases, which can then explode. And Bess facilities contain millions of battery cells that, if not shielded or widely-enough separated, allow fires to spread fast. Meanwhile, when fires do occur, contaminants can be released into the air and water - although a recent review of large-scale Bess fires in the US since 2012 found that emissions are largely confined to the immediate vicinity of the fire. Getty Images The batteries at Bess facilities are generally stored in rows of metal boxes Back in the UK, locals are currently fighting a proposed Bess installation by Blackford Renewables at Rothienorman in Aberdeenshire. ""They don't have any consideration for the residents that live outside their red line around their property, they don't take the residents into consideration for flood risk or fire,"" says campaigner Marguerite Fleming. A spokesperson for Blackford Renewables says the company is still working on the details of its proposals, and promises to engage with the community. ""We take local concerns about fire safety very seriously, and we are committed to maintaining the highest safety standards through the use of advanced technology, fire safety systems and close coordination with emergency services,"" he says. Prof Dryfe says that fires are indeed a risk - not just at the Bess installations themselves, but also at the recycling plants that deal with the batteries at the end of their life. ""Recycling's obviously a good thing, but taking batteries apart isn't a risk-free process, and fires can start there,"" he says. Other factors holding back wider Bess installation include humanitarian and environmental concerns about the mining of necessary materials such as cobalt, while in Germany there are fears that the national grid simply can't cope with the number of facilities springing up. Marguerite Fleming Marguerite Fleming is campaigning against a Bess site being built in Aberdeenshire","Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are facing significant public safety concerns, primarily due to fire risks, despite being crucial for achieving net-zero emissions. Recent incidents, including major fires in California (leading to evacuations), Essex, and Liverpool, highlight the danger of ""thermal runaway"" in the lithium-ion batteries used in these facilities. This process can cause rapid, widespread fires, releasing flammable and toxic gases, and contaminating air and water, leading to strong community opposition in areas like Staten Island and Aberdeenshire.

However, experts like Professor Robert Dryfe underscore that BESS facilities are indispensable for integrating intermittent renewable energy sources, preventing waste, and ensuring a consistent power supply. The EU alone aims for a tenfold increase in battery storage by 2030. While alternatives such as cryogenic storage and hydropower exist, they are currently considered ""niche"" and insufficient to meet the required scale. Beyond direct fire risks, concerns also extend to potential fires at recycling plants, as well as humanitarian and environmental issues associated with the mining of necessary materials. Developers maintain their commitment to safety and community engagement, but the challenge lies in balancing the urgent need for large-scale energy storage with public safety and environmental protection.","यहां अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद दिया गया है:

Last month, Trump said he had sacked Ms Cook but the Fed said she remains as a governor. The ruling is a win for the central bank in an unprecedented legal battle with the White House over the independence of the Fed. A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Donald Trump from sacking Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, who is part of the board responsible for setting US interest rates. The Fed declined to comment on the ruling but has previously said it would abide by the court's decision. The White House said: ""This ruling will not be the last say on the matter, and the Trump administration will continue to work to restore accountability and confidence in the Fed."" Trump has repeatedly criticised the Fed, in particular its chair Jerome Powell, for not cutting interest rates while central banks in Europe and the UK have trimmed borrowing costs. The Fed has held off cuts while it assesses the impact of Trump's tariffs on inflation. Ms Cook's lawyer Abbe David Lowell said: ""This ruling recognises and reaffirms the importance of safeguarding the independence of the Federal Reserve from illegal political interference. ""Governor Cook will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed board governor."" Ms Cook sued Trump over his attempt to fire her, setting up a potential legal battle with implications for the US central bank's autonomy. Trump and Federal Housing and Finance Authority director William Pulte have claimed that Ms Cook inaccurately described three different properties on mortgage applications, which may have enabled her to obtain lower interest rates and tax credits. The law that created the Fed says governors can only be removed ""for cause,"" but does not define what that means or how that could be done in practice. It is the first time that a president has tried to fire a Fed governor, and the law has yet to be tested in court. Judge Cobb wrote: ""The best reading of the 'for cause' provision is that the bases for removal of a member of the board of governors are limited to grounds concerning a governor's behaviour in office and whether they have been faithfully and effectively executing their statutory duties. ""'For cause' thus does not contemplate removing an individual purely for conduct that occurred before they began in office."" In response to the ruling, a spokesperson for the White House claimed: ""President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause due to credible allegations of mortgage fraud from her highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions on the Federal Reserve board of governors."" The case - which is likely to end up in the US Supreme Court - is seen as crucial to the central bank's ability to set interest rates without political influence. The Fed is due to meet next week and is expected to announce its first interest rate cut since September 2024.","A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, a ruling widely seen as a victory for the central bank's independence. Judge Jia Cobb determined that the ""for cause"" provision for removing a Fed governor applies only to conduct in office, not to pre-appointment allegations.

Trump had attempted to dismiss Cook last month over claims of mortgage fraud prior to her appointment, stating the removal was lawful. This marks the first time a president has tried to fire a Fed governor.

The White House, however, plans to challenge the decision, asserting the matter is not resolved and indicating the case, which is crucial for the Fed's autonomy in setting interest rates, is likely to reach the US Supreme Court. Cook, a member of the board responsible for setting US interest rates, will continue her sworn duties.

हालांकि, व्हाइट हाउस ने इस फैसले को चुनौती देने की योजना बनाई है, यह दावा करते हुए कि मामला अभी सुलझा नहीं है। व्हाइट हाउस ने यह भी संकेत दिया है कि यह मामला, जो ब्याज दरें तय करने में फेड की स्वायत्तता के लिए महत्वपूर्ण है, संभवतः अमेरिकी सुप्रीम कोर्ट तक पहुंचेगा। कुक, जो अमेरिकी ब्याज दरें निर्धारित करने के लिए जिम्मेदार बोर्ड की सदस्य हैं, अपने शपथ-ग्रहण के कर्तव्यों का निर्वहन जारी रखेंगी।

यह कानूनी लड़ाई ट्रंप द्वारा फेड की ब्याज दरें न घटाने को लेकर की जा रही बार-बार की आलोचना के बीच चल रही है। केंद्रीय बैंक अगले हफ्ते सितंबर 2024 के बाद से अपनी पहली ब्याज दर में कटौती की घोषणा करने की उम्मीद कर रहा है।",en,[],,The judge's ruling is a win for the US Federal Reserve following criticism by the president.,[''],www.bbc.com/business,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It marks a significant milestone for the Swedish lending giant, which has cast itself as a challenger to credit cards and traditional banks. Founded in 2005, the company is known for allowing shoppers to pay for purchases in smaller, interest-free instalments and has proven popular, with more than 100 million active users across 26 countries. But the firm has faced ongoing questions about the risk that its business model could lead people to spend beyond their means. Klarna handled transactions worth $105bn last year. It is a major global player in the shopping space, entering the UK in 2014 and the US in 2019. In its home country of Sweden, more than 80% of adults used the service last year, according to the company. In a message to staff shared by the company, chief executive Sebastian Siemiatkowski said the moment would provide ""fuel"" to the company as it seeks to make similar inroads in other markets. The firm raised $1.37bn in the initial public offering (IPO), selling shares alongside some longtime investors for $40 apiece. Shares opened for trading at $52 apiece, surging 30% from the IPO price - which had valued the firm at $15bn - to more than $19bn. But shares drifted lower by end of day, settling around $46 and putting the firm's value at $17bn. The company continues to trade at a discount compared with 2021, when an investment by Softbank Group put the value of the firm at more than $45bn. The firm was subsequently hit by economic slowdown and rising interest rates. Joakim Dal, a partner at Bullhound Capital, said he thought investors had misunderstood Klarna, which makes the bulk of its money by charging a fee to sellers for purchases involving its pay later service. ""In our view it's more of a payment company than a lender,"" he told the BBC's Opening Bell show, noting the ""very low"" rates of late payments. ""It's more about facilitating a smooth experience on the payment side than about providing credit to consumers."" Last year, Klarna reported revenue of $2.8bn, up 24% year-on-year. But since entering the US, its profitability has suffered, as it faces higher costs for processing transactions. It reported a $52m loss in the three months to June, up from $7m a year ago.","Klarna, the Swedish buy-now, pay-later (BNPL) provider, made its debut on Wall Street, initially valued at $19 billion.

Founded in 2005, Klarna has positioned itself as a challenger to traditional credit cards and banks, boasting over 100 million active users across 26 countries and handling $105 billion in transactions last year. Despite its global expansion, including entries into the UK in 2014 and the US in 2019, the company has faced ongoing scrutiny regarding the potential for its model to encourage overspending.

Its valuation has significantly declined from over $45 billion in 2021, impacted by economic slowdowns and rising interest rates. Klarna's profitability has also suffered since its US entry due to higher transaction processing costs, reporting a $52 million loss in the three months to June, up from $7 million a year prior.

स्वीडिश बाय-नाउ, पे-लेटर (बीएनपीएल) सेवा प्रदाता क्लार्ना ने वॉल स्ट्रीट पर पदार्पण किया, जिसका शुरुआती मूल्यांकन 19 अरब डॉलर था। कंपनी, जो खरीदारों को ब्याज-मुक्त किश्तों में खरीदारी का भुगतान करने की सुविधा देती है, के शेयर शुरुआती दिन अपने 40 डॉलर के आईपीओ मूल्य से 30% बढ़कर 52 डॉलर हो गए, हालांकि बाद में वे 46 डॉलर पर स्थिर हो गए, जिससे फर्म का मूल्य 17 अरब डॉलर हो गया। क्लार्ना ने आईपीओ में सफलतापूर्वक 1.37 अरब डॉलर जुटाए।

2005 में स्थापित, क्लार्ना ने खुद को पारंपरिक क्रेडिट कार्ड और बैंकों के लिए एक चुनौती के रूप में स्थापित किया है, जो 26 देशों में 10 करोड़ से अधिक सक्रिय उपयोगकर्ताओं और पिछले साल 105 अरब डॉलर के लेनदेन का दावा करती है। 2014 में यूके और 2019 में अमेरिका में प्रवेश सहित अपने वैश्विक विस्तार के बावजूद, कंपनी को इस आशंका को लेकर लगातार जांच का सामना करना पड़ा है कि उसका मॉडल अत्यधिक खर्च को बढ़ावा दे सकता है।

2021 में 45 अरब डॉलर से अधिक रहा इसका मूल्यांकन आर्थिक मंदी और बढ़ती ब्याज दरों से प्रभावित होकर काफी गिर गया है। अमेरिका में प्रवेश के बाद से उच्च लेनदेन प्रसंस्करण लागत के कारण क्लार्ना की लाभप्रदता को भी नुकसान हुआ है; जून तक के तीन महीनों में इसने 5.2 करोड़ डॉलर का नुकसान दर्ज किया है, जो एक साल पहले के 70 लाख डॉलर के नुकसान से काफी अधिक है।

सीईओ सेबेस्टियन सीमियात्कोव्स्की ने कहा कि आईपीओ कंपनी को ""ईंधन"" प्रदान करेगा। विश्लेषक जोआकिम डल का तर्क है कि निवेशक अक्सर क्लार्ना को गलत समझते हैं, उनका दावा है कि यह एक पारंपरिक ऋणदाता के बजाय एक ""भुगतान कंपनी"" के रूप में अधिक कार्य करती है जो विक्रेताओं से शुल्क लेती है, इसके ""बहुत कम"" विलंबित भुगतान दरों और एक सहज भुगतान अनुभव की सुविधा पर इसके ध्यान का हवाला देते हुए। पिछले साल, क्लार्ना ने 2.8 अरब डॉलर का राजस्व दर्ज किया, जो साल-दर-साल 24% की वृद्धि है।",en,[],,"The buy-now, pay-later firm raises nearly $1.4bn as its shares start trading publicly.",[''],www.bbc.com/business,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The move comes a day after the agency issued a revision to job figures showing growth last year was far weaker than it had previously estimated. The office of the Labor Department's inspector general said it had launched a probe to look at the ""challenges"" the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) faces gathering and updating the information. The US Labor Department's internal watchdog has launched an investigation into how it gathers jobs and inflation data after intense White House criticism of the agency. In a letter to acting commissioner William Wiatrowski, the Labor Department's office of inspector general said the decision to launch the probe was a response to the job report revisions and BLS moves to reduce collection of price information. It follows a Labor Department report published on Tuesday showed that the US economy had added 911,000 fewer jobs than initial estimates in the 12 months to March this year, a larger downward revision than economists had expected. The BLS has faced longstanding concerns that a drop in initial response rates might reduce the quality of its surveys. However, Democrats and some economists have voiced alarm that the White House is seeking to politicise economic data. Trump's decision to nominate conservative economist EJ Antoni who has a reputation for partisan analysis as the new commissioner of the BLS was widely panned. Economists have also criticised recent cuts to BLS panels involving outside experts and decisions to reduce collection of price data, which had been attributed to inadequate funding and staff. The Trump administration has maintained it is seeking to improve the quality of the reports and modernise the office. The office of the inspector general has examined issues with BLS data before. Its report in 2023, which focused on concerns that initial response rates to BLS surveys had declined, concluded that the agency could ""do more"" identify the limits of its data and be transparent about its assumptions. It has also examined the BLS for issues related to its release of the data.","**US Watchdog Probes Economic Data Collection After White House Criticism, Job Revisions**

The U.S. Labor Department's internal watchdog has launched an investigation into how the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects and updates jobs and inflation data. This probe follows intense White House criticism, including President Donald Trump's firing of the previous BLS head, and comes shortly after significant downward revisions to job growth figures.

Trump had accused the former BLS head, without evidence, of manipulating job numbers to undermine him. The investigation by the Labor Department's inspector general was specifically triggered by these recent job report revisions, which showed the U.S. economy added 911,000 fewer jobs than initially estimated in the 12 months to March, and by BLS moves to reduce price information collection.

Beyond these immediate catalysts, the probe will also examine longstanding ""challenges"" faced by the BLS, including concerns over declining initial response rates impacting data quality and recent cuts to panels involving outside experts, attributed to funding and staffing issues. Democrats and some economists have expressed alarm that the White House is attempting to politicize economic data, a concern heightened by Trump's widely criticized nomination of conservative economist EJ Antoni, known for partisan analysis, as the new BLS commissioner.

The Trump administration, however, maintains it is seeking to improve the quality of reports and modernize the office. The inspector general's office has previously examined issues with BLS data, including concerns about declining survey response rates and transparency, as well as the agency's data release practices.","**व्हाइट हाउस की आलोचना और रोजगार आंकड़ों में संशोधन के बाद अमेरिकी निगरानी संस्था ने आर्थिक डेटा संग्रह की जांच शुरू की**

अमेरिकी श्रम विभाग की आंतरिक निगरानी संस्था ने इस बात की जांच शुरू की है कि श्रम सांख्यिकी ब्यूरो (बीएलएस) रोजगार और मुद्रास्फीति के आंकड़ों को कैसे एकत्र और अद्यतन करता है। यह जांच व्हाइट हाउस की तीव्र आलोचना के बाद शुरू हुई है, जिसमें राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प द्वारा पूर्व बीएलएस प्रमुख को बर्खास्त करना भी शामिल है, और यह रोजगार वृद्धि के आंकड़ों में महत्वपूर्ण गिरावट वाले संशोधनों के तुरंत बाद आई है।

ट्रम्प ने पूर्व बीएलएस प्रमुख पर, बिना किसी सबूत के, उन्हें कमजोर करने के लिए रोजगार संख्याओं में हेरफेर करने का आरोप लगाया था। श्रम विभाग के महानिरीक्षक द्वारा यह जांच विशेष रूप से हालिया रोजगार रिपोर्ट संशोधनों के कारण शुरू की गई थी, जिसमें दिखाया गया था कि मार्च तक के 12 महीनों में अमेरिकी अर्थव्यवस्था ने शुरुआती अनुमान से 911,000 कम नौकरियां जोड़ी थीं, और बीएलएस द्वारा मूल्य संबंधी जानकारी के संग्रह को कम करने के कदमों के कारण भी।

इन तात्कालिक कारणों से परे, जांच में बीएलएस के सामने आने वाली लंबे समय से चली आ रही ""चुनौतियों"" की भी जांच की जाएगी, जिसमें डेटा गुणवत्ता को प्रभावित करने वाली शुरुआती प्रतिक्रिया दरों में गिरावट और बाहरी विशेषज्ञों को शामिल करने वाले पैनलों में हालिया कटौती की चिंताएं शामिल हैं, जिनका कारण धन और कर्मचारियों की कमी को बताया गया है। डेमोक्रेट और कुछ अर्थशास्त्रियों ने चिंता व्यक्त की है कि व्हाइट हाउस आर्थिक डेटा का राजनीतिकरण करने का प्रयास कर रहा है, यह चिंता ट्रम्प द्वारा रूढ़िवादी अर्थशास्त्री ई.जे. एंटोनी, जो पक्षपातपूर्ण विश्लेषण के लिए जाने जाते हैं, को नए बीएलएस आयुक्त के रूप में नामित करने के व्यापक रूप से आलोचनात्मक फैसले से और बढ़ गई है।

हालांकि, ट्रम्प प्रशासन का कहना है कि वह रिपोर्टों की गुणवत्ता में सुधार और कार्यालय का आधुनिकीकरण करना चाहता है। महानिरीक्षक के कार्यालय ने पहले भी बीएलएस डेटा से संबंधित मुद्दों की जांच की है, जिसमें सर्वेक्षण प्रतिक्रिया दरों में गिरावट और पारदर्शिता के साथ-साथ एजेंसी की डेटा जारी करने की प्रथाओं के बारे में चिंताएं शामिल हैं।",en,[],,The move follows White House criticism of the Bueau of Labor Statistics.,[''],www.bbc.com/business,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proposals from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) mean entering a four-digit PIN to make a card payment could become even more of a rarity for shoppers. If approved, purchases which can cost more than £100 - such as a big supermarket shop, or large family meal in a restaurant - could be made with a tap of a card. The move would bring cards in line with payments made through digital wallets on smartphones which have no restriction, and reflects the ongoing changes in the way people pay. When contactless card payments were introduced in 2007, the transaction limit was set at £10. The limit was raised gradually, to £15 in 2010, to £20 in 2012, then to £30 in 2015, before the Covid pandemic prompted a jump to £45 in 2020, then to £100 in October 2021. If approved, the latest plan could be put in place early next year. Every rise has been met with concerns about theft and fraud, and the FCA said card providers would only permit higher-value contactless payments for low-risk transactions and would carry the burden if things went wrong. However, the freedom for banks to raise or even scrap the contactless limit suggests the four-digit PIN could soon become relatively redundant. The FCA has proposed the changes, despite the majority of consumers and industry respondents to a consultation favouring the current rules. Some 78% of consumers who responded said they did not want any change to the limits. The FCA said it did not expect any quick changes, but providers would welcome the flexibility over time when prices rise and technology advances. They could also give customers the option to set their own limits. Fraud and theft fears The idea of high-value payments being made with a tap of a card will raise concern that thieves and fraudsters will target cards. Various protections are already in place. In addition to the £100 single payment limit, consumers are often required to enter a PIN if a series of contactless transactions totals more than £300, or five consecutive contactless payments are made. The FCA's own analysis suggests raising the limits would increase fraud losses, but said detection was improving and would continue to get better. It said any change would be reliant on providers ensuring payments were low-risk, through their fraud prevention systems. Consumers would still get their money back if money was stolen by fraudsters, according to David Geale, from the FCA. ""People are still protected. Even with contactless, firms will refund your money if your card is used fraudulently,"" he said. Many banks already allow cardholders to set a contactless limit of lower than £100, or switch it off completely, and the FCA expected this option to be made widely available. It argued that time savings, less ""payment friction"", and a reflection of rising prices over time would make changes in the limits worthwhile. Payment terminals would also need to be altered, as most are programmed to automatically refuse payments of more than £100 by card. UK Finance, which represents banks, said: ""Any changes will be made thoughtfully with security at the core."" 'I only use my phone to pay' Smartphones already have an extra layer of security, through thumbprints or face ID. That allows people to pay without limits. Nearly three-quarters of 16 to 24-year-olds regularly use mobile payments, according to industry research. Near the appropriately named Bank Street in Sevenoaks, 24-year-old Demi Grady said she rarely bothered carrying her cards around anymore because she used her phone for everything. ""I was in London the other day, my phone died and I couldn't pay for stuff because I couldn't remember my card details,"" she said. Her mum, Carrie, in contrast, uses her card when shopping. ""It would worry me more than be of benefit if they were to lose the limit of £100,"" she said. Robert says the contactless limit can be a useful budgeting reminder Robert Ryan, who had just bought a ""winter-ish jacket"" at a Harveys Menswear on Bank Street said he did not regard entering a four-digit number when paying as a hassle. Instead it could be a useful budgeting tool. ""I feel more secure in what I'm buying and it does give me a bit of a prompt to make sure I'm not overspending on my tap-and-go,"" he said. Richard Staplehurst, the owner of the store, said the majority of his customers were paying via a device. He said that removing any obstacles to payment was great, but he did not want to be landed with a bill if a card was used fraudulently. Stimulating the UK economy","The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed significant changes that could allow banks to set unlimited or much higher contactless card payment limits, potentially making PIN entry a rarity for even large purchases. This move aims to align physical cards with the unrestricted payment options available via smartphone digital wallets and reflects the ongoing evolution of payment methods.

Contactless limits have progressively risen from £10 in 2007 to £100 in October 2021. If approved, these latest plans could be implemented by early next year. However, the proposals are met with substantial concern; 78% of consumers and industry respondents to a consultation favored maintaining current limits, citing fears of increased theft and fraud.

Despite these concerns, the FCA asserts that consumers will remain protected and eligible for refunds in cases of fraud, emphasizing that card providers would only permit higher-value contactless payments for low-risk transactions. They also anticipate that banks will offer customers the flexibility to set their own lower limits. The FCA justifies the changes by highlighting benefits like time savings and reduced ""payment friction,"" though it acknowledges that payment terminals will require updates.

While some consumers welcome the convenience, others, like one shopper, express worry over the security implications of removing the £100 cap, or value the PIN as a useful budgeting reminder.

कॉन्टैक्टलेस सीमाएँ 2007 में £10 से धीरे-धीरे बढ़कर अक्टूबर 2021 में £100 हो गई हैं। यदि अनुमोदित हो जाते हैं, तो ये नवीनतम योजनाएँ अगले साल की शुरुआत तक लागू की जा सकती हैं। हालांकि, इन प्रस्तावों पर काफी चिंता व्यक्त की गई है; एक परामर्श में 78% उपभोक्ता और उद्योग के उत्तरदाताओं ने चोरी और धोखाधड़ी बढ़ने के डर का हवाला देते हुए मौजूदा सीमाओं को बनाए रखने के पक्ष में मतदान किया।

इन चिंताओं के बावजूद, एफ.सी.ए. का दावा है कि उपभोक्ता सुरक्षित रहेंगे और धोखाधड़ी के मामलों में रिफंड के पात्र होंगे। एफ.सी.ए. ने जोर दिया कि कार्ड प्रदाता केवल कम जोखिम वाले लेनदेन के लिए उच्च-मूल्य के कॉन्टैक्टलेस भुगतान की अनुमति देंगे। वे यह भी उम्मीद करते हैं कि बैंक ग्राहकों को अपनी कम सीमाएँ निर्धारित करने की छूट देंगे। एफ.सी.ए. समय की बचत और ""भुगतान घर्षण"" (payment friction) में कमी जैसे लाभों को उजागर करके इन बदलावों को उचित ठहराता है, हालांकि वह स्वीकार करता है कि भुगतान टर्मिनलों को अपडेट की आवश्यकता होगी।

Ellison's wealth surged to $393bn (£290bn) on Wednesday morning, surpassing Musk's $385bn (£284bn), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The jump came after shares in Oracle, which make up a significant part of Ellison's fortune, soared more than 40%, boosted by the database software company's surprisingly rosy outlook for its cloud infrastructure business and artificial intelligence (AI) deals. But the firm's share price had shed some of those gains by the end of the day, putting Musk back on top. Before briefly losing it to Ellison, Musk had held the title of world's richest person for nearly one year. He could receive a pay package worth over $1tn (£740bn) if he hits a list of ambitious targets over the next decade, the board of the electric car firm has proposed. But shares in Musk's most valuable business, Tesla, have fallen this year. The electric vehicle maker has grappled with investor jitters over the Trump administration's rollback of electric vehicle initiatives, on top of consumer backlash to Musk's political involvement. Oracle has recently been propelled by growing demand for data centre infrastructure. The company projected as part of its quarterly earnings report on Tuesday that revenue from its cloud business will jump 77% this year, to $18bn, with further growth expected in the coming years. Oracle has reported a surge in demand among AI companies for its data centres, which helped push its stock dramatically higher.

इतिहासकार ऐनी सुड्रो के दावों के बाद, स्विस कंपनी वेलेडा ने नाज़ी शासन और डचाऊ यातना शिविर से अपने कथित संबंधों की जांच शुरू की है।

सुड्रो की रिपोर्ट में आरोप है कि वेलेडा ने डचाऊ के एक बगीचे से कच्चा माल प्राप्त किया और एक एंटी-हाइपोथर्मिया क्रीम बनाई, जिसका कथित तौर पर एसएस (SS) डॉक्टर सिगमंड राशर ने भयानक मानव प्रयोगों में इस्तेमाल किया था। अगस्त 1942 और मई 1943 के बीच किए गए इन प्रयोगों में कथित तौर पर 300 तक कैदियों को क्रीम की प्रभावशीलता का परीक्षण करने के लिए बर्फ के पानी में स्नान करने के लिए मजबूर किया गया था, जिसके परिणामस्वरूप 90 तक मौतें हुईं।

वेलेडा ने नाज़ी अत्याचारों की निंदा की है और कहा है कि जबकि 2023 की एक रिपोर्ट में डॉ. राशर द्वारा कैदियों पर अपनी क्रीम का परीक्षण करने का कोई सबूत नहीं मिला था, कंपनी मानती है कि ये नए निष्कर्ष ""पिछले शोध में पूरी तरह से जांचे नहीं गए होंगे।""

Havertz has a knee injury that will keep him out for weeks, Saka has been unavailable since the 5-0 win over Leeds with a hamstring injury, while centre-back Saliba was withdrawn with an ankle problem in the defeat at Liverpool. Midfielder Odegaard has had a shoulder problem and was again withdrawn against Forest after an awkward fall. The absence of this quartet would usually be a cause for crisis at Arsenal, and injuries to their influential players last season was a major factor in why the Gunners fell away in the title race to finish second behind Liverpool and falter in the Champions League semi-final against Paris St-Germain. While Arteta will be eager for those players to return, his side - led by impressive England duo Noni Madueke and Eberechi Eze - proved they have the talent and options to cope and get results. When asked about his summer recruitment, the Spaniard said: ""If we wouldn't have done that and, as you said, with the injuries that we have, unfortunately some of them are very difficult to control, we would have been in a very different place. ""We knew that that was the standard, that's the standard of the other teams in the league in Europe, and you can see that. ""I'm very happy because it gives us options, it gives us the capacity as well to change games, it gives the capacity to have presence in the team, and now we have to make sure that everybody feels connected and important."" Arsenal travel to Spain on Tuesday to face Athletic Bilbao for the first of their Champions League games this season and Arteta said that was another reason the club decided to invest. ""The players have to play 70 or 74 games throughout the season. It's never been done,"" he added. ""When the intensity was that high, they are not going to be able to sustain that. So you need more players, the standards have raised, we need better players and there's no secret."" It was a sentiment backed up by former Arsenal defender Martin Keown. ""That was a real scary show of strength from Arsenal, with the quality of player. You've been without Havertz, and Saka unavailable, and that was a problem for Arsenal last season, but not this,"" he told TNT Sports. ""Madueke, Eze coming in today, both of them outstanding. Gyokeres, what about that second goal, so direct, forward pass. This man in the box, a real predator. ""The quality of the group, even this young man [Cristhian Mosquera] at the back, what a performance that was. His full debut at Arsenal, home game, outstanding. ""At the moment, Arsenal are looking so strong.""","Despite a significant injury crisis sidelining key players like Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka, William Saliba, and Martin Odegaard, Arsenal is effectively maintaining its performance due to strategic high-calibre player recruitment. Manager Mikel Arteta emphasized that this summer investment was crucial to avoid a drop in quality, especially given the relentless schedule, the physical demands of potentially 70-74 games per season, and the increased standards in the league and Europe, as well as their Champions League commitments.

Arteta stated that without these new signings, the club ""would have been in a very different place,"" contrasting sharply with last season when injuries to influential players derailed their title challenge. Now, the squad depth allows the team to cope and secure results, with players like Noni Madueke and Eberechi Eze delivering ""outstanding"" performances and young talents such as Cristhian Mosquera impressing on debut. Former manager Arsene Wenger also lauded the team's current ""scary show of strength"" and the quality of the group, highlighting Arsenal's robust position.","काई हावर्ट्ज़, बुकायो साका, विलियम सालिबा और मार्टिन ओडेगार्ड जैसे प्रमुख खिलाड़ियों के चोटिल होने से मैदान से बाहर होने के एक बड़े संकट के बावजूद, आर्सेनल रणनीतिक रूप से उच्च-स्तरीय खिलाड़ियों की भर्ती के कारण अपने प्रदर्शन को प्रभावी ढंग से बनाए हुए है। मैनेजर मिकेल आर्टेटा ने जोर देकर कहा कि इस गर्मी का निवेश गुणवत्ता में गिरावट से बचने के लिए महत्वपूर्ण था, खासकर अथक कार्यक्रम, प्रति सीज़न संभावित 70-74 मैचों की शारीरिक माँगों, और लीग व यूरोप में बढ़े हुए मानकों के साथ-साथ उनकी चैंपियंस लीग प्रतिबद्धताओं को देखते हुए।

It is a mark of success for the Olympic and former world mountain bike champion in his first Grand Tour where he has prioritised the general classification over stage wins.

""It's maybe not the biggest win - others are more special - but I'm exhausted, to be honest, and I can't really find any words.""

Cyclists were quickly diverted around a group of about 50 protesters and the race was able to continue without significant disruption. Race organisers had announced the the 21st and final stage of the Vuelta would be shortened from 111.6km to 103.6km. Organisers did not specify a reason for the section removed, which would have crossed the plush Madrid neighbourhood of Aravaca. There have been various protests against the Israel-Premier Tech team throughout the race, forcing stages to be shortened. Riders have crashed as a result of the protests, with some saying they have been worried for their safety. Last week, Israel-Premier Tech began racing in modified jerseys which did not display their team. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 64,605 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.","Jonas Vingegaard is on the cusp of securing his first Vuelta a Espana title, while Britain's Tom Pidcock has guaranteed his maiden Grand Tour podium finish.

Denmark's Vingegaard, 28, solidified his lead by winning the gruelling climb up Bola del Mundo in the penultimate stage, finishing 11 seconds ahead of team-mate Sepp Kuss. This victory extended his general classification lead over Portugal's Joao Almeida to one minute and 16 seconds heading into Sunday's ceremonial final stage. Pidcock, 26, finished fourth in the stage, ensuring his third-place overall standing, 30 seconds ahead of Jai Hindley. Both cyclists expressed immense pride, with Pidcock calling it ""the biggest performance of my career.""

However, the race was also marked by significant pro-Palestinian protests. During the penultimate stage, approximately 50 protesters briefly attempted to block the road near the finish, though cyclists were diverted, and the race continued without significant disruption. Organisers had also shortened the final stage by removing a section, and several earlier stages had been altered due to ongoing demonstrations targeting the Israel-Premier Tech team. These protests reportedly led to rider safety concerns, crashes, and prompted the team to race in modified jerseys without displaying their name. The demonstrations are linked to the ongoing conflict in Gaza, which escalated following the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel in October 2023 and the subsequent Israeli military campaign, resulting in a substantial death toll.","यहाँ अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

हालांकि, यह दौड़ महत्वपूर्ण फिलिस्तीन समर्थक विरोध प्रदर्शनों से भी चिह्नित थी। अंतिम से पहले के चरण के दौरान, लगभग 50 प्रदर्शनकारियों ने समाप्ति के पास सड़क को अवरुद्ध करने का संक्षिप्त प्रयास किया, हालांकि साइकिल चालकों को मोड़ दिया गया और दौड़ बिना किसी बड़ी बाधा के जारी रही। आयोजकों ने एक खंड को हटाकर अंतिम चरण को भी छोटा कर दिया था, और इज़राइल-प्रीमियर टेक टीम को निशाना बनाने वाले चल रहे प्रदर्शनों के कारण कई शुरुआती चरणों में बदलाव किया गया था। इन विरोध प्रदर्शनों के कारण कथित तौर पर सवारों की सुरक्षा संबंधी चिंताएं, दुर्घटनाएं हुईं और टीम को अपना नाम प्रदर्शित किए बिना संशोधित जर्सी में दौड़ने के लिए प्रेरित किया। ये प्रदर्शन गाजा में चल रहे संघर्ष से जुड़े हैं, जो अक्टूबर 2023 में दक्षिणी इज़राइल पर हमास के नेतृत्व वाले हमले और बाद के इजरायली सैन्य अभियान के बाद बढ़ गया था, जिसके परिणामस्वरूप एक बड़ी मौत का आंकड़ा हुआ है।",en,[],,Jonas Vingegaard powers to victory in stage 20 to close in on his first Vuelta a Espana title while Britain's Tom Pidcock tightens his grip on a first Grand Tour podium finish.,[''],www.bbc.com/sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rest of the South Africa squad would roll their eyes when yet another stranger would walk in for a meeting with him. It led to dealings with unscrupulous characters. In particular those involved with betting, and there was an early portent of what was to come in 1996. Before a one-off ODI between South Africa and India, tagged on to the end of a Test tour as a benefit match for Mohinder Amarnath, Cronje called a meeting in their Mumbai hotel for the players to consider an offer of $250,000 to throw the match. It was rejected, but it showed how secure Cronje was in his position. ""Bringing it up in a team meeting was indicative of the power and untouchability that he felt,"" observed South African journalist Neil Manthorp. Fast forward to Nagpur in 2000, Cronje attempted to coerce South Africa batter Herschelle Gibbs and seam bowler Henry Williams into spot-fixing offences. Both men agreed, but subsequently did not carry out the instructions. ""I always found it a struggle to actually say 'no' to him, you know?"" reflected Gibbs. ""He was regarded in such high esteem and respected so much, and I never once thought of the consequences."" Both Gibbs and Williams were non-white players but suggestions it was racially motivated are dismissed by those who knew Cronje. Still, how was Cronje able to manipulate his team-mates with such ease? Manthorp said he was on an ""elevated platform"" and ""very few people were prepared to stand up to him"". ""Hansie had quite a temper. He'd become, I think, accustomed to not being questioned,"" he added. The most infamous of Cronje's dealings with bookmakers came during the rain-affected fifth Test between South Africa and England at Centurion Park in early 2000. With the Proteas recommencing their first innings on the fifth day Cronje - prompted by a bookie named Marlon Aronstam - contrived an unprecedented innings forfeiture for both sides to ensure a result. England captain Nasser Hussain later compared his agreement with Cronje over what target his side would chase to the haggle scene in Monty Python's Life of Brian - Cronje immediately accepted the figure Hussain asked for. Cronje's innovative action to create a result on what otherwise would have been a dead final day of a Test largely drew praise, even if did not quite sit right with everyone. ""After the initial celebrations I realised I did not experience the usual euphoria that would follow a Test win,"" said Butcher. ""Almost instantly I knew why - it didn't feel we'd earned it."" Michael Holding, covering the match for Sky Sports, received ""tons of phone calls and letters"" over something he said on air during a commentary stint, having smelt a rat. ""I said if this game was being played on the Indian subcontinent, people would start talking about bookmakers,"" Holding said. ""I just knew something was going on and that was my total focus. I was basically disgusted at what I was watching.""","Hansie Cronje's ""love of money"" made him unusually accessible, particularly to questionable individuals during tours in South Asia, a fact noted with concern by his teammates. This led to his involvement in dealings with unscrupulous characters, betting, and scams.

An early indication of his compromised position came in 1996 in Mumbai, when Cronje offered his team $250,000 to throw an ODI. Though the team rejected the offer, it underscored his perceived ""power and untouchability."" By 2000, in Nagpur, Cronje directly coerced teammates Herschelle Gibbs and Henry Williams into spot-fixing, though they agreed but did not follow through. Teammates like Gibbs found it difficult to refuse Cronje due to his high esteem, unchallenged authority, and known temper, with one journalist describing his position as an ""elevated platform"" where few dared to question him. Suggestions that his manipulation of Gibbs and Williams was racially motivated were dismissed.

The most infamous incident occurred during the rain-affected Centurion Test against England in early 2000. Prompted by bookmaker Marlon Aronstam, Cronje orchestrated an unprecedented innings forfeiture to create a result on what would have been a drawn match. While this innovative move initially drew praise for making a game, some, like teammate Butcher, felt the victory was ""unearned."" Commentator Michael Holding famously ""smelt a rat"" during the match, expressing his disgust on air and noting that if such an event occurred in the Indian subcontinent, it would immediately be linked to bookmakers.","यहाँ उस अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

She shakes hands with everyone, introducing herself warmly before taking her seat, careful not to ruin her glamorous dress. It is clear Kang is a highly-intelligent woman from early conversations. She has humour, compassion and a lot of knowledge in what she talks about. Her multi-club ownership model has become a topic of conversation as women's football continues to grow and explores new ways to seek revenue. She has invested heavily in London City Lionesses' infrastructure, playing staff and female-specific research and it has paid off so far. Will it become a model that others follow? ""I don't know if they say 'we will follow this model' but I think if you come into women's football and have real, genuine interests of supporting women's football, it's a no-brainer conclusion,"" says Kang. ""We don't have the huge media deal that the men have. We don't sell-out stadiums yet. We don't have hundreds and millions of dollars of corporate sponsorships. But we still want to advance women's football by investing in it. ""So what's the natural conclusion? You have to build a scale. There is no reason why every team should invest in female research. We should pool that research together and share it. It's the same with global scouting. ""I know it has bad connotations on the men's side with greed and all those things, but in women's football it's a necessity until we have decent commercial resources available."" Kang glows with pride at the work being done behind her, turning to point at the training ground's construction work to improve facilities. She has used the Premier League as a benchmark on the standards required for success and has designed, with architects, a plan she wants to replicate across all her clubs to provide the best environment. Kang returns to this when asked if it is upsetting that some suggest she signs players from her other clubs in a way of manipulating the market. Does she sign players from Paris St-Germain, Lyon's rivals, to benefit her French club? It is one of the main criticisms of multi-club ownership - a model which is not universally liked. ""I understand it because they haven't seen this yet so it's only natural for people to assume that because in the men's world, [it is perceived that] teams buy players so they can sell them for a much higher price,"" adds Kang. ""In the absence of any other alternative, it's not unreasonable to think, 'oh, that is what she is doing'. I get that. My job is to ensure I don't do that so they can appreciate they are not the same models. ""It is not about building a feeder system - that is not the purpose. It is to bring critical scale so we can invest in all the necessary infrastructure and research how our players need to be the best athletes. So we can put out the best product, so we can bring more people into the stadiums, and the media finds women's sport attractive. ""It's all related and all necessary. While we're talking about comparisons... women's football is very different to men's football. We should really treat this differently.""","Charismatic and highly intelligent investor Kang is a prominent advocate for a multi-club ownership model in women's football. Her strategy, exemplified by significant investment in clubs like London City Lionesses, focuses heavily on infrastructure, playing staff, and female-specific research, which has already shown positive returns.

Kang argues this model is a ""no-brainer"" and a ""necessity"" to achieve ""critical scale,"" given women's football's current lack of large media deals, sponsorships, and stadium sell-outs compared to the men's game.

The 29-year-old lit up Old Trafford with an unbeaten 141 off 60 deliveries to not only shatter a host of individual records - most notably reaching three figures off just 39 balls to beat Liam Livingstone's England record - but also propel his side beyond 300 for the first time in T20s. England amassed 304-2, a record total in a T20I between two Test nations, in a blistering display of hitting before bowling South Africa out for 158 to level the series at 1-1 going into Sunday's decider in Nottingham. Salt was aggressive from ball one, immediately dispatching Marco Jansen for a trio of boundaries, and went on to find the rope no fewer than 23 times, including eight sixes, in his monster knock. ""Enjoying being there at the crease for as long as you can and just a will to impact the game, that's how I see it,"" Salt said. ""I want to take games as deep as possible while still batting at a high strike-rate. The two don't often go hand in hand but that's what I want to do as a player. ""The goal is to be right up there.

South Africa were subsequently bowled out for 158, leaving the series level at 1-1 ahead of the decider.

Roig's availability came to attention over the summer and the pair worked together in a covert trial following Wimbledon. Raducanu likes to learn and once put her high turnover of coaches down to asking ""provoking"" questions. She found Roig's sessions to be stimulating, challenging and instantly encouraging. ""Francis is very passionate for tennis,"" said Vilaro. ""What's amazing is he can watch a match on TV and he doesn't care about the result - he's checking how they are moving, the positioning and how they are hitting the ball. He's watching many specific things. ""When we created the academy he said, 'I want to do it but I don't want any paperwork. I just want to be on the court'. The court is his passion."" Raducanu has already impressed Roig with her work ethic. In his first tournament at the helm, the pair had multiple daily practices at the Cincinnati Open, where she confidently breezed past Serbia's Olga Danilovic before – more notably – pushing world number one Aryna Sabalenka to her limit. While Raducanu fell short of a shock, it was a promising performance which provides optimism for the US Open. ""I spoke to Francis after Raducanu beat Danilovic and before she played Sabalenka,"" said Vilaro. ""He said, 'It's amazing, I like working with this player a lot because she loves to be on court. We spent two hours training the return, the return plus second shot and what to do when the opponent attacks'. ""He enjoyed it a lot. The most important thing for him is having a player who loves being on court - and it looks like this is the case.""","Emma Raducanu has officially partnered with new coach Francis Roig, a collaboration that followed a covert trial after Wimbledon and is already showing promising signs. Raducanu had been assessing her options after previous candidate Petchey was unable to commit to a full-time role.

Known for her desire to be challenged and to learn through ""provoking"" questions, Raducanu has found Roig's sessions stimulating, challenging, and instantly encouraging. Roig, in turn, is described as intensely passionate about tennis, with a highly analytical eye for movement, positioning, and technique, often observing matches without regard for the result. He prefers hands-on court work over administrative tasks, a dedication lauded by his manager and other colleagues like Stan Wawrinka.

The partnership is marked by mutual admiration: Roig is impressed by Raducanu's strong work ethic and her love for being on court, a quality he considers paramount in a player. Their initial training has included specific drills focusing on returns and attacking strategies.

In their first tournament together, Raducanu delivered a strong performance, confidently defeating Olga Danilovic and pushing world number one Aryna Sabalenka to her limits. While she ultimately fell short of a shock win, the encouraging display has generated significant optimism for the upcoming US Open, signalling a potentially strong new chapter for Raducanu under Roig's guidance.","एम्मा रादुकानू ने आधिकारिक तौर पर नए कोच फ्रांसिस रोइग के साथ साझेदारी की है। यह सहयोग विंबलडन के बाद एक गुप्त ट्रायल से होकर गुज़रा और पहले से ही आशाजनक संकेत दिखा रहा है। इससे पहले, रादुकानू अपने विकल्पों का आकलन कर रही थीं क्योंकि पिछले उम्मीदवार पेटचेई पूर्णकालिक भूमिका के लिए प्रतिबद्ध नहीं हो पाए थे।

यह साझेदारी आपसी प्रशंसा से भरी है: रोइग रादुकानू की मजबूत कार्य नीति और कोर्ट पर रहने के उनके प्यार से प्रभावित हैं, एक ऐसा गुण जिसे वह एक खिलाड़ी में सबसे महत्वपूर्ण मानते हैं। उनके शुरुआती प्रशिक्षण में रिटर्न और आक्रामक रणनीतियों पर केंद्रित विशिष्ट अभ्यास शामिल रहे हैं।

एक साथ अपने पहले टूर्नामेंट में, रादुकानू ने शानदार प्रदर्शन किया, आत्मविश्वास से ओल्गा दानिलोविक को हराया और विश्व नंबर एक आर्यना सबलेंका को कड़ा मुकाबला देते हुए उनकी सीमाओं तक धकेल दिया। हालांकि वह अंततः एक अप्रत्याशित जीत से चूक गईं, इस उत्साहवर्धक प्रदर्शन ने आगामी यूएस ओपन के लिए काफी उम्मीदें जगाई हैं, जो रोइग के मार्गदर्शन में रादुकानू के लिए एक संभावित मजबूत नए अध्याय का संकेत देता है।",en,[],,Emma Raducanu recently appointed another full-time coach in Spaniard Francisco Roig - BBC Sport speaks to those who know him best.,[''],www.bbc.com/sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ordinarily, a rematch leaves one fighter seeking adjustments to overturn a loss, but in this instance, it is the winner of the first fight viewed as the one with it all to do. At the time of the stoppage in March, Donovan led on all three scorecards despite being docked a point in rounds six and eight for fouls.

It's 02:00 in Washington. Stephan Weiler is woken by a ""dreaded call"". A voice said: ""Is Becky Zerlentes your wife?' ""I said 'yes', and the official from Denver Health Medical Center and Hospital told me I need to get to the airport as quickly as possible. Her condition was deteriorating."" Up until that day, a female boxer in the United States had never died in a sanctioned fight. In succumbing to that devastating blow, Zerlentes - who three years previously won a regional boxing title - had rewritten history. While the tales of fighters like Johnny Owen and Jimmy Doyle, external are enshrined in history, the impact of Zerlentes' death on the community in Denver and on those who loved her has remained private. Zerlentes' love affair with combat sports defined her life, an overwhelming rush every time she stepped inside the confines of a boxing ring or MMA cage. Like most amateur fighters, 34-year-old Zerlentes embraced a career away from the ropes, working as a geography and economics instructor at Front Range Community College's Larimer County campus, earning a master's and PhD. The buzz she enjoyed inside the classroom was complemented by her love of sport, especially in combat. On that fight night, Weiler continued his three-year stay at the Federal Reserve, the country's central banking system. He had constantly been asked by Zerlentes to return to Fort Collins, the former military outpost nestled in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, and promised he soon would. Facing Heather Schmitz, Zerlentes was taking part in the Colorado State Boxing Senior Female Championships at the Denver Coliseum in Colorado, a venue that has crammed more than 10,000 people in when the Rolling Stones or Rage Against the Machine have been in town. Both women wore protective headgear. For two rounds Zerlentes worked, trading punches with Schmitz until the third. With a blow to the head, just above her left eye, Zerlentes staggered forward, struck the canvas and fell unconscious - a state she would remain in until her death the following morning. ""The doctor in the ring said her pupils were fixed and dilated when he saw her first and already there was a chance that brain damage had occurred,"" Weiler, now a professor, said. By 06:30 Weiler was on a flight to Denver and immediately made his way to the hospital. There he saw Zerlentes. ""The amount of damage to Becky's brain was remarkable given that it was a fairly glancing blow,"" he said. ""It was not a hard hit... but the brain had become bruised to such an extent that it could no longer operate."" The life support Zerlentes had been placed on was beginning to fail, and that ""clinically she was probably already dead in the ring"", Weiler recalled. And then he had to make a choice. ""At about noon that morning, the decision was made, knowing that her condition was deteriorating, I made the choice that it was time, as I knew the window for organ donation, which Becky so fervently supported, was closing,"" he said. The reaction to her death was immediate. Tributes flooded in across Denver. Colleagues, students and others who knew Zerlentes described the warmth and tenacity of one of the college and community's pillars.","On April 3, 2005, an event unfolded surrounding the tragic death of Becky Zerlentes, an amateur boxer and college instructor, following a sanctioned fight in Denver. Her husband, Stephan Weiler, received a distressing late-night call and immediately traveled to Denver Health Medical Center.

Zerlentes had been competing in the Colorado State Boxing Senior Female Championships at the Denver Coliseum, wearing protective headgear. In the third round, after trading punches with opponent Schmitz, she sustained a blow to the head above her left eye, causing her to stagger, fall unconscious, and suffer severe brain damage. Despite the blow being described as ""glancing"" and ""not a hard hit,"" her brain was bruised beyond recovery.

She remained unconscious, and her condition rapidly deteriorated on life support. Weiler was informed that she was clinically dead in the ring and made the difficult decision to remove her from life support, also considering her strong support for organ donation. Zerlentes, a geography and economics instructor at Front Range Community College and a former military member, was defined by her love for combat sports. Her death marked a tragic and historically significant event in U.S. female boxing, leading to an immediate outpouring of tributes from colleagues, students, and the Denver community who remembered her warmth and tenacity.","3 अप्रैल, 2005 को, डेनवर में एक स्वीकृत मुकाबले के बाद शौकिया मुक्केबाज़ और कॉलेज प्रशिक्षक बेकी ज़ेरलेनटेस की दुखद मौत से जुड़ी एक घटना सामने आई। उनके पति, स्टीफन वेइलर को रात में एक परेशान करने वाला फोन आया और वह तुरंत डेनवर हेल्थ मेडिकल सेंटर के लिए रवाना हो गए।

ज़ेरलेनटेस डेनवर कोलिज़ीयम में कोलोराडो स्टेट बॉक्सिंग सीनियर फीमेल चैंपियनशिप में सुरक्षात्मक हेडगियर पहने हुए प्रतिस्पर्धा कर रही थीं। तीसरे राउंड में, प्रतिद्वंद्वी श्मिट्ज़ के साथ मुक्कों का आदान-प्रदान करने के बाद, उनके बाएं आंख के ऊपर सिर पर एक वार लगा, जिससे वह लड़खड़ा गईं, बेहोश हो गईं और उन्हें गंभीर मस्तिष्क क्षति हुई। हालांकि इस वार को 'हल्का' और 'तेज नहीं' बताया गया था, फिर भी उनका मस्तिष्क इतनी बुरी तरह चोटिल हो गया था कि वह ठीक होने की संभावना से परे था।

वह बेहोश ही रहीं और लाइफ सपोर्ट पर उनकी हालत तेजी से बिगड़ती गई। वेइलर को बताया गया कि रिंग में ही वह चिकित्सकीय रूप से मृत हो चुकी थीं और उन्होंने उनकी अंगदान के लिए मजबूत समर्थन को भी ध्यान में रखते हुए, उन्हें लाइफ सपोर्ट से हटाने का कठिन निर्णय लिया। फ्रंट रेंज कम्युनिटी कॉलेज में भूगोल और अर्थशास्त्र की प्रशिक्षक और पूर्व सैन्य सदस्य ज़ेरलेनटेस को लड़ाकू खेलों के प्रति उनके प्रेम के लिए जाना जाता था। उनकी मृत्यु अमेरिकी महिला मुक्केबाजी में एक दुखद और ऐतिहासिक रूप से महत्वपूर्ण घटना थी, जिसके बाद सहकर्मियों, छात्रों और डेनवर समुदाय से तत्काल श्रद्धांजलि अर्पित की गईं, जिन्होंने उनकी गर्मजोशी और दृढ़ता को याद किया।",en,[],,The story of Becky Zerlentes - the first female boxer to die in a sanctioned fight in the United States.,[''],www.bbc.com/sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She ripped League1 Ontario up. By the time the semi-professional league came to an end, she had scored 18 goals in 11 games and it would be the last time playing club football in her home country. That summer she moved south of the border, to Penn State University in Pennsylvania. Again, her time there was fleeting. Despite arriving at Penn State with a serious cruciate ligament injury, sustained at the Under-20 World Cup, and a frail run of form, the calls from Europe arrived by the end of her freshman year. ""It was neat to watch her be able to be an 18-year-old because I don't think there's been a lot of times where she's been able to be her actual age,"" said former Penn State University head coach Dambach. ""Since leaving Penn State she has put herself out there and put herself in uncomfortable situations and I think through those she was able to really grow and develop."" And so, one year on from that season in Canada, she had left college and moved to Portugal to join Sporting, despite heavy interest in France and England. Batlle y Font was instrumental in persuading Smith to move to the relatively obscure Portuguese league - and reaped the rewards. ""I won't say that our project is better than those clubs, obviously it's different,"" said the 30-year-old. ""I think she understood that we really wanted her. ""I think that she chose us because she understood that she would have the same rights and same duties as other players, but she would not be one more player. ""Once she made the decision, we never felt that she was looking at us as a minor club, compared to the other clubs interested in her."" It did not take her long to make an impression in Portugal. ""She was 18 and she was playing against experienced players and she would make a bit of a fool of them. ""When she played we would look at each other and say, 'how did we fool this girl to be here? How lucky are we?'"" Again by the end of another fruitful season, she was packing her bags and Batlle y Font was receiving enquiries from multiple clubs in Europe. ""There were more clubs interested and, to be honest, with better offers than Liverpool, but not the kind of project that Olivia wanted,"" said Batlle Y Font. ""Once again, this shows how very grounded Olivia is."" Her debut season in the WSL saw her score seven goals in 20 games for Liverpool, as well as being named the PFA young player of the year. When she arrived at Arsenal this summer, it was her third club in three years. ""I definitely think it's not comfortable, but you have to be comfortable being uncomfortable,"" said Smith, speaking to reporters in pre-season. ""And it's been quite tough for me personally, not knowing what's going to come next. ""Like my first season, I never expected to leave after one season, especially last season, only having one season in what I think is the best league in the world and then coming here. ""So it's certainly not easy, especially with my family so far away, but it does make transitions easier.""","Canadian football prodigy Olivia Smith has rapidly ascended through top-tier leagues, navigating frequent club changes and personal challenges. In 2022, Smith showcased her talent by scoring 18 goals in 11 games in Canada's League1 Ontario before moving to Penn State University. Despite arriving with a serious cruciate ligament injury from the U-20 World Cup, European clubs expressed interest by the end of her freshman year.

After just one year in college, Smith chose to join Sporting in Portugal, a move orchestrated by Batlle y Font, who emphasized the club's unique project and genuine desire for her, despite more prominent offers from France and England. As an 18-year-old, she quickly made a significant impact, earning the admiration of both fans and teammates.

Following a successful season in Portugal, Smith moved to Liverpool in the Women's Super League (WSL), where her debut season saw her score seven goals in 20 games and earn the PFA Young Player of the Year award. Now at Arsenal, her third club in three years, Smith acknowledges the personal difficulty of constant relocation and ""uncomfortable situations,"" but views these experiences as crucial for her growth and development, asserting the need to ""be comfortable being uncomfortable.""","कनाडाई फुटबॉल की विलक्षण प्रतिभा ओलिविया स्मिथ ने शीर्ष स्तरीय लीगों में तेजी से प्रगति की है, इस दौरान उन्हें लगातार क्लब बदलने और व्यक्तिगत चुनौतियों का सामना करना पड़ा है। 2022 में, स्मिथ ने कनाडा की लीग1 ओंटारियो में 11 मैचों में 18 गोल करके अपनी प्रतिभा का प्रदर्शन किया, जिसके बाद वह पेन स्टेट यूनिवर्सिटी चली गईं। अंडर-20 विश्व कप से एक गंभीर क्रूसिएट लिगामेंट चोट के साथ पहुंचने के बावजूद, उनके फ्रेशमैन वर्ष के अंत तक यूरोपीय क्लबों ने उनमें रुचि दिखाई।

कॉलेज में सिर्फ एक साल बिताने के बाद, स्मिथ ने पुर्तगाल के स्पोर्टिंग क्लब में शामिल होने का फैसला किया। यह कदम बैटल वाई फोंट द्वारा सुनियोजित किया गया था, जिन्होंने फ्रांस और इंग्लैंड से अधिक प्रमुख प्रस्तावों के बावजूद क्लब की अनूठी परियोजना और ओलिविया के लिए उनकी सच्ची इच्छा पर जोर दिया। 18 साल की उम्र में, उन्होंने जल्दी ही एक महत्वपूर्ण प्रभाव डाला, और प्रशंसकों व टीम के साथियों दोनों की प्रशंसा अर्जित की।

पुर्तगाल में एक सफल सीज़न के बाद, स्मिथ महिला सुपर लीग (WSL) में लिवरपूल चली गईं। वहां, अपने पहले सीज़न में, उन्होंने 20 मैचों में सात गोल किए और उन्हें PFA यंग प्लेयर ऑफ द ईयर का पुरस्कार मिला। अब आर्सेनल में हैं, जो तीन साल में उनका तीसरा क्लब है। स्मिथ लगातार जगह बदलने और 'असहज परिस्थितियों' की व्यक्तिगत कठिनाई को स्वीकार करती हैं, लेकिन इन अनुभवों को अपनी वृद्धि और विकास के लिए महत्वपूर्ण मानती हैं। उन्होंने इस बात पर जोर दिया कि 'असहज होने में सहज होना' (be comfortable being uncomfortable) आवश्यक है।",en,[],,"Meet the person behind women's football's first £1m player, Arsenal's new superstar forward Olivia Smith.",[''],www.bbc.com/sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And then my wife now, girlfriend at the time, she had a little bit of the same as my mum and my dad. She always kept me very low. She was always very supportive of me, but always, like, just be aware that things can go wrong. So just don't think too much ahead. Just think about the moment and what you want for the future, but make that the moment that will help you to achieve that in the future. As a family, we always had that from my childhood. And then going to pass that to my young kids now, it's amazing because the way I and my wife think is very similar. So together that was very good. Then as manager I think [Francesco] Guidolin was the one that changed my career at Udinese because he was another one that made me play. He made me think about everything I had to do. He made me learn that to get into the top level you will have to suffer.","Bruno attributes his grounded approach to life and career to the strong influence of his family. His parents instilled in him a belief in limitless potential, always encouraging him to pursue his dreams, while simultaneously keeping him humble and balanced (""never think too high or too low""). His wife, then girlfriend, reinforced this supportive realism, providing kindness, reminding him of potential pitfalls, and encouraging him to focus on the present moment as a path to future achievements. Bruno is now proudly passing these cherished family values and this shared philosophy to his own children.

Professionally, he credits manager Francesco Guidolin at Udinese for a career-changing impact. Guidolin not only gave him opportunities to play but also taught him the vital lesson that reaching the highest level in one's field necessitates a willingness to ""suffer"" and persevere.","ब्रूनो अपने जीवन और करियर के प्रति अपने ज़मीन से जुड़े दृष्टिकोण का श्रेय अपने परिवार के मज़बूत प्रभाव को देते हैं। उनके माता-पिता ने उनमें असीमित क्षमता में विश्वास जगाया, हमेशा उन्हें अपने सपनों को पूरा करने के लिए प्रोत्साहित किया। साथ ही, वे उन्हें विनम्र और संतुलित भी रखते थे, इस सीख के साथ कि ""कभी भी खुद को बहुत ऊँचा या बहुत नीचा मत समझो।"" उनकी पत्नी, जो उस समय उनकी प्रेमिका थीं, ने इस सहायक यथार्थवाद को और दृढ़ किया। वे उन्हें स्नेह देती थीं, संभावित चुनौतियों की याद दिलाती थीं और उन्हें वर्तमान क्षण पर ध्यान केंद्रित करने के लिए प्रोत्साहित करती थीं, इसे भविष्य की उपलब्धियों का मार्ग बताती थीं। ब्रूनो अब गर्व से इन पोषित पारिवारिक मूल्यों और इस साझा दर्शन को अपने बच्चों तक पहुँचा रहे हैं।

""It hardly seems sensible for girls to want to take part in this particularly brutal contact sport,"" wrote celebrated journalist Jack McLean. ""Why girls of teenage years wish to eschew such adolescent delights as make-up, nice clothes, elaborate hair-dos and mooning about after boys of a Saturday afternoon in favour of brawling in the glaur of a wet Scottish playing field in the winter is beyond me."" And he was one of women's rugby's more supportive observers at the time. Not quite the Stone Age, but we are now more than a quarter of a century distant from Scotland's last success over their neighbours. Scotland edged to an 8-5 victory in the 1998 Home Nations - a precursor to the Women's Six Nations - and then took a 15-13 win in a third-place play-off at the European Championship in Italy a year later. Donna Kennedy, Scotland's most capped player, played in both. ""We were a very good, strong side at that time,"" she told BBC Sport. ""But we were still always the underdogs, because England have always been good at what they do. Even back then they were the team to beat. ""That game in 1999 - up a mountain in Italy - was really tight. ""It was very much an up-front battle in the forwards. I can remember it being quite a feisty game. ""The game has changed now, but back then you could still put a boot on and ruck someone out.""","Scotland's women's rugby team has not defeated England in over a quarter of a century, with their last successes against their neighbours dating back to the late 1990s. While the Scottish men's team secured a 2-1 Six Nations victory in November 2010, the drought for the women's side is significantly longer.

The early days of women's rugby faced considerable societal skepticism. Celebrated journalist Jack McLean, despite being considered one of the more supportive observers in the 1990s, notably questioned the ""sensible[ness]"" of girls participating in the ""brutal contact sport,"" expressing bewilderment as to why they would prefer ""brawling in the glaur"" over ""adolescent delights"" like make-up and dating. Indeed, contact rugby for girls faced restrictions in the UK after its introduction in the 1970s.

Scotland's last victories against England were an 8-5 win in the 1998 Home Nations (a precursor to the Women's Six Nations) and a tight 15-13 third-place play-off victory at the European Championship a year later. Both historic matches featured Donna Kennedy, Scotland's most capped player, who described her side as ""very good, strong"" yet ""always the underdogs"" against a consistently dominant England. The 1999 encounter, played ""up a mountain in Italy,"" was recalled as a ""feisty"" and ""up-front battle in the forwards,"" with players noting the more physical rules of the era, such as being able to ""put a boot on and ruck someone out."" These wins represent a bygone era for Scottish women's rugby, highlighting the enduring challenge of overcoming their English rivals.","स्कॉटलैंड की महिला रग्बी टीम ने एक चौथाई सदी से भी अधिक समय से इंग्लैंड को नहीं हराया है, उनकी पड़ोसियों के खिलाफ आखिरी जीत 1990 के दशक के अंत में दर्ज की गई थी। जहाँ स्कॉटलैंड की पुरुष टीम ने नवंबर 2010 में सिक्स नेशंस में 2-1 से जीत हासिल की थी, वहीं महिला टीम के लिए यह सूखा काफी लंबा है।

महिला रग्बी के शुरुआती दिनों में काफी सामाजिक संदेह का सामना करना पड़ा था। प्रसिद्ध पत्रकार जैक मैकलीन, जिन्हें 1990 के दशक में अधिक सहायक पर्यवेक्षकों में से एक माना जाता था, ने भी लड़कियों के ""क्रूर संपर्क खेल"" में भाग लेने की ""समझदारी"" पर सवाल उठाया था, यह व्यक्त करते हुए कि उन्हें मेकअप और डेटिंग जैसे ""किशोरावस्था के सुखों"" के बजाय ""कीचड़ में झगड़ना"" क्यों पसंद होगा। वास्तव में, 1970 के दशक में लड़कियों के लिए संपर्क रग्बी की शुरुआत के बाद यूके में इस पर प्रतिबंध लगा दिए गए थे।

इंग्लैंड के खिलाफ स्कॉटलैंड की आखिरी जीत 1998 के होम नेशंस (महिला सिक्स नेशंस का अग्रदूत) में 8-5 की जीत और एक साल बाद यूरोपीय चैंपियनशिप में 15-13 से तीसरा स्थान प्ले-ऑफ की कड़ामुकाबला जीत थी। दोनों ऐतिहासिक मैचों में स्कॉटलैंड की सबसे अधिक कैप वाली खिलाड़ी डोना कैनेडी शामिल थीं, जिन्होंने अपनी टीम को ""बहुत अच्छी, मजबूत"" बताया, फिर भी लगातार हावी इंग्लैंड के सामने वे ""हमेशा कमजोर"" थीं। 1999 की वह भिड़ंत, जो ""इटली के एक पहाड़ पर"" खेली गई थी, को ""उत्साहपूर्ण"" और ""फॉरवर्ड्स में सीधा मुकाबला"" याद किया जाता है, जिसमें खिलाड़ियों ने उस युग के अधिक शारीरिक नियमों का उल्लेख किया, जैसे कि ""किसी को हटाने के लिए बूट का इस्तेमाल करना और रकिंग करना""। ये जीतें स्कॉटिश महिला रग्बी के लिए एक बीते हुए युग का प्रतिनिधित्व करती हैं, जो उनके अंग्रेजी प्रतिद्वंद्वियों पर काबू पाने की निरंतर चुनौती को उजागर करती हैं।",en,[],,"England have not lost to Scotland this millennium.

Team GB made the podium in every relay event at the Paris 2024 Olympics, supplying five of the nation's 10 athletics medals at last summer's Games. That came after four relay medals were won at the previous World Championships two years ago, which included silver for the mixed 4x400m quartet on that occasion. In Saturday's earlier session in Japan, the British squad had qualified for the final with the second-fastest time but Lewis Davey, Emily Newnham, Toby Harries and Nicole Yeargin finished fifth in the medal race, just 0.23 seconds shy of the podium in a close finish behind runaway winners the United States. Team USA equalled the championship record in three minutes 08.80 seconds to take gold, with the Netherlands - anchored by hurdles star Femke Bol - and Belgium completing the podium. ""Great Britain will obviously come away disappointed. We perhaps hoped they might have been a little bit more in the mix than they were,"" four-time global heptathlon champion Jessica Ennis-Hill said on BBC One. ""Overall it was a very tough race.

We're here to win medals, we're GB, we're not here to just compete. ""I went out as hard as I could to try and hold it. I just didn't have that endgame.""

The Australian has had limited time to put his stamp on this Forest side but a few differences were evident pointing to the direction Postecoglou might look to take Forest. The most obvious was starting with a back four. It appears the 4-4-1-1 that Postecoglou has deployed across his career is to be maintained. Stylistically, Forest aimed to build in a slower fashion - looking to establish territory higher up the pitch, rather than playing the more direct, counter-attacking style that was successful last season. Data from Opta showed that their 'direct speed' - how quickly they move the ball from defence to attack - was their joint-lowest for a game in the league since the start of last season. Out of possession, they set up in what looked like a 4-2-3-1 shape and defended in a man-marking fashion. We will have to see more from Postecoglou to know if this man-to-man approach defensively is something they persist with or if this was specific to Arsenal given their quality and rotation-heavy style. Nuno by comparison tended to set Forest up in a zonal fashion (meaning each player defended specific zones, rather than following individual players) but did use a man-to-man defence at times against the league's top teams. Forest's defensive line was set higher up the pitch than under Nuno, but they were punished for this with Gyokeres' strike. Arsenal exploited a long pass over the top of the defence for Eze to run on to as Forest failed to apply pressure on the passer. Naturally, Forest's collective understanding of when to push up and apply pressure will improve with time. Lastly, the biggest difference between Postecoglou's tactics today with how he has set up his teams at previous clubs was the use of full-backs. In build-up, Forest played in a fairly standard 4-3-3 shape with full-backs starting in wide positions rather than inverting into midfield as has been the norm in his sides. Was this a short-term tactic given the lack of preparation time? It is difficult to make any definitive conclusions based on a single game in Postecoglou's first week in charge; however there were numerous new ideas at play against Arsenal that may become more evident in upcoming weeks.","In his initial match as Nottingham Forest manager, Ange Postecoglou introduced several significant tactical shifts despite having only one week in charge. While definitive conclusions are premature, Forest appeared to adopt his favoured 4-4-1-1 formation, transitioning to a 4-3-3 in build-up with full-backs positioned wide, a departure from his previous inverted full-back usage.

Stylistically, the team moved away from last season's direct, counter-attacking approach, opting for a slower build-up to establish higher territory, as evidenced by Opta's 'direct speed' data. Defensively, Forest operated in a 4-2-3-1 shape, employing a man-marking system and a higher defensive line, a change from Nuno Espírito Santo's predominantly zonal setup. This higher line was exploited by Arsenal with a long pass for their goal, highlighting an area for improvement in collective understanding and pressure.

The long-term permanence of these specific tactics, particularly the man-marking and full-back roles, remains to be seen, potentially influenced by the limited preparation time. However, Postecoglou's distinct new ideas were clearly at play, setting a new direction for the club.","नॉटिंघम फ़ॉरेस्ट के मैनेजर के रूप में अपने पहले मैच में, एंग पोस्तेकोग्लू ने प्रभारी के तौर पर सिर्फ एक हफ़्ते का समय मिलने के बावजूद कई महत्वपूर्ण सामरिक बदलाव पेश किए। हालांकि, कोई पुख्ता निष्कर्ष निकालना अभी जल्दबाजी होगी, लेकिन फ़ॉरेस्ट ने उनकी पसंदीदा 4-4-1-1 फॉर्मेशन अपनाई हुई प्रतीत हुई, जो गेंद बनाते समय (बिल्ड-अप में) 4-3-3 में बदल जाती थी, जिसमें फुल-बैक को चौड़ा (वाइड) तैनात किया गया था। यह उनके पिछले इनवर्टेड फुल-बैक के उपयोग से हटकर था।

शैलीगत रूप से, टीम पिछले सीज़न के सीधे, जवाबी हमले (काउंटर-अटैकिंग) के तरीके से हट गई, और अधिक क्षेत्र (टेरिटरी) स्थापित करने के लिए धीमी बिल्ड-अप का विकल्प चुना, जैसा कि ऑप्टा के 'डायरेक्ट स्पीड' डेटा से पता चलता है। रक्षात्मक रूप से, फ़ॉरेस्ट ने 4-2-3-1 के आकार में काम किया, जिसमें मैन-मार्किंग प्रणाली और एक उच्च रक्षात्मक पंक्ति (डिफेंसिव लाइन) का उपयोग किया गया। यह नूनो एस्पिरिटो सैंटो की मुख्य रूप से ज़ोनल प्रणाली से एक बदलाव था। इस उच्च पंक्ति का फायदा आर्सेनल ने अपने गोल के लिए एक लंबी पास के साथ उठाया, जो टीम की सामूहिक समझ और दबाव बनाने में सुधार के एक क्षेत्र को उजागर करता है।

इन विशिष्ट रणनीति, विशेष रूप से मैन-मार्किंग और फुल-बैक की भूमिकाओं की दीर्घकालिक स्थिरता अभी देखना बाकी है, जो संभवतः सीमित तैयारी के समय से प्रभावित हुई है। हालांकि, पोस्तेकोग्लू के विशिष्ट नए विचार स्पष्ट रूप से खेल में थे, जिससे क्लब के लिए एक नई दिशा तय हुई।",en,[],,"Ange Postecoglou says his appointment at Nottingham Forest is not a ""project"" and he will seek to instantly implement a new style of play at the club.",[''],www.bbc.com/sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

British number two Cameron Norrie sealed a place in February's qualifiers - and therefore a chance to go after the 2026 title - with victory over Poland's Olaf Pieczkowski on Saturday. Norrie produced a professional performance, dropping just three points on serve, to win 6-4 6-4 against the world number 484 and give Britain an unassailable 3-1 lead in the best-of-five World Group 1 tie. ""Honestly, I think we've got a really good chance [of winning],"" said Smith. ""It comes down to who is available to play. You need your top players to try and win it - that's clear. But I hope the players are motivated to play."" Smith was without British number one Draper in Poland because of a season-ending arm injury that caused the 23-year-old to withdraw from the US Open after a first-round win. ""I think there's an appetite from our top players to want to play, and of course if you have got someone like Jack [Draper], when he comes into the team and you've got a top-tenner, it obviously makes a difference as well,"" said Smith. ""We've got good depth with Cam [Norrie], Jacob [Fearnley], Arthur [Fery] and there's others, and with strong doubles options you have a chance."" Britain last won the Davis Cup in 2015 when Sir Andy Murray was part of the team. Norrie's victory to seal Britain's place in February's first round came after Wimbledon champions Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool missed an earlier chance when they lost their doubles rubber. The world number one pairing, making their Davis Cup debuts, were stunned 3-6 6-3 7-6 (8-6) by Karol Drzewiecki and Jan Zielinski. That outcome put the onus on Norrie to clinch the tie for Britain or risk the team facing a deciding match, and he came up with the required result to earn high fives from colleagues at courtside. Britain had needed just one win on Saturday to progress from the tie after Norrie and Arthur Fery, who made his Davis Cup debut in the absence of Draper and Fearnley, won their respective singles matches on Friday. Defeat in Poland would have meant a February play-off which could have resulted in relegation to World Group 2, but instead they are heading back to the elite level.","Great Britain has secured a spot in next year's Davis Cup qualifiers after defeating Poland 3-1 in their World Group 1 tie, effectively avoiding relegation. Cameron Norrie clinched the decisive point with a dominant performance against Olaf Pieczkowski.

Captain Leon Smith expressed strong optimism about Great Britain's chances of winning the Davis Cup, stating they have a ""really good chance"" if world number seven Jack Draper is fit and available. Draper was absent from the Poland tie due to a season-ending arm injury, but Smith emphasized that player availability and motivation are crucial for success.

Despite a loss from debutant doubles pair Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool, Norrie's win, alongside Arthur Fery's singles victory on Friday, ensured Britain's progression to the elite level. Smith also highlighted the team's ""good depth"" and strong doubles options. Britain, who last won the Davis Cup in 2015, is now aiming for their first title since 1986.","**डेविस कप: ग्रेट ब्रिटेन ने पोलैंड को हराकर अगले साल के क्वालिफायर में बनाई जगह**

ग्रेट ब्रिटेन ने अपने वर्ल्ड ग्रुप 1 टाई में पोलैंड को 3-1 से हराकर अगले साल के डेविस कप क्वालिफायर में अपनी जगह पक्की कर ली है। इस जीत से उन्होंने निचले स्तर में जाने (रेलीगेशन) से भी खुद को बचा लिया है। कैमरन नॉरी ने ओलाफ पीज़कोव्स्की के खिलाफ शानदार प्रदर्शन करते हुए निर्णायक अंक हासिल किया।

कप्तान लियोन स्मिथ ने डेविस कप जीतने की ग्रेट ब्रिटेन की संभावनाओं पर दृढ़ आशावाद व्यक्त किया। उन्होंने कहा कि यदि विश्व के सातवें नंबर के खिलाड़ी जैक ड्रेपर फिट और उपलब्ध होते हैं, तो उनके पास ""वास्तव में अच्छा मौका"" होगा। ड्रेपर सत्र समाप्त करने वाली हाथ की चोट के कारण पोलैंड टाई से अनुपस्थित थे, लेकिन स्मिथ ने इस बात पर जोर दिया कि खिलाड़ियों की उपलब्धता और प्रेरणा सफलता के लिए महत्वपूर्ण हैं।

पदार्पण करने वाली डबल्स जोड़ी जूलियन कैश और लॉयड ग्लासपूल की हार के बावजूद, नॉरी की जीत और शुक्रवार को आर्थर फेयरी की एकल जीत ने ब्रिटेन को शीर्ष स्तर में आगे बढ़ना सुनिश्चित किया। स्मिथ ने टीम की ""अच्छी गहराई"" और मजबूत डबल्स विकल्पों पर भी प्रकाश डाला।

Perhaps Sunday's game showed that the veteran has mellowed - and that he is able to compensate for his limited movement following his season-ending injury in 2023. ""He's able to get the ball out so fast and be so accurate, and he's making changes at the line of scrimmage,"" said Schecter. ""The way his brain works, he's like having a coach on the football field. ""He has really developed so much, not just from a quarterback perspective, but in terms of how he's managing his team-mates,"" she added. ""There's a great example in the game when DK Metcalf, a star receiver, drops the football. Perhaps in the past, Rodgers wouldn't have gone back to him, but the next play he gets the football in his hands. That's the new version of Aaron Rodgers that we're so excited to see."" Rodgers, whose solitary Super Bowl win came against Pittsburgh in 2011, turns 42 in December, but Tom Brady won his last Super Bowl aged 43 and retired at 45. The Steelers have not won a play-off game since 2017 but Mike Tomlin is used to grinding out results as, since becoming their head coach in 2007, he is yet to have a losing season. ""I don't think age is the issue [for Rodgers],"" said Schecter. ""I mean, look at Tom Brady and what he was able to do. I think he's changed the narrative around what age you can be in order to play this amazing sport, especially at quarterback. ""And because of [Rodgers'] football IQ, there's no defence that he has not seen or come up against in all of his years, so it's really up to him."" What could be Rodgers' farewell tour continues at home to the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday. Pittsburgh play the Minnesota Vikings in Dublin on 28 September and have two of the NFL's best quarterbacks in their division - the AFC North - so Rodgers could play two games against both Lamar Jackson (Baltimore) and Joe Burrow (Cincinnati). He is set to face last season's MVP, Josh Allen (Buffalo), and has a reunion with Green Bay scheduled for 26 October in Pittsburgh. Schecter said: ""Does he want to continue to play after this? Or is this a season where he thinks, I'm with a team who are perennial winners, they always make it to the play-offs. They've just been missing that little spice, and maybe Aaron Rodgers can be that extra bit that pushes them all the way to bring home a Lombardi Trophy.""","Aaron Rodgers appears to have adopted a more mellow leadership style this season, a notable shift from his past demanding demeanor. Despite limited mobility following his 2023 season-ending injury, experts commend his quick, accurate passing and pre-snap adjustments, with some likening his high football IQ to having a ""coach on the field."" Coach Todd Graham highlighted Rodgers' enhanced team management, exemplified by his immediate decision to re-target a star receiver after a dropped pass, showcasing a ""new version"" of the quarterback.

Approaching 42, Rodgers is challenging the narrative around age in professional football, drawing comparisons to Tom Brady's late-career success. His extensive experience means he has encountered every defensive scheme. While this season could potentially be his ""farewell tour,"" featuring a challenging schedule including matchups against top quarterbacks, the key question remains whether he will continue playing beyond this year, potentially driven by the desire to secure another Lombardi Trophy with a perennial winning team.","**एरॉन रॉजर्स ने अपनाई नई नेतृत्व शैली, मैदान पर ""कोच"" जैसा प्रदर्शन**

एरॉन रॉजर्स ने इस सीज़न में एक अधिक शांत नेतृत्व शैली अपनाई है, जो उनके पिछले मांग करने वाले (या कठोर) रवैये से एक उल्लेखनीय बदलाव है। 2023 में सीज़न समाप्त करने वाली चोट के कारण सीमित गतिशीलता के बावजूद, विशेषज्ञ उनकी तेज़, सटीक पासिंग और प्री-स्नैप समायोजन की सराहना करते हैं। कुछ लोग उनके उच्च फुटबॉल IQ की तुलना मैदान पर एक ""कोच"" होने से करते हैं। कोच टॉड ग्राहम ने रॉजर्स के बेहतर टीम प्रबंधन पर प्रकाश डाला, जिसका उदाहरण एक छूटे हुए पास के तुरंत बाद एक स्टार रिसीवर को फिर से निशाना बनाने के उनके निर्णय से मिलता है, जो क्वार्टरबैक के एक ""नए संस्करण"" को दर्शाता है।

42 के करीब पहुँचते हुए, रॉजर्स पेशेवर फुटबॉल में उम्र को लेकर प्रचलित धारणा को चुनौती दे रहे हैं, जिनकी तुलना टॉम ब्रैडी की करियर के अंतिम पड़ाव की सफलता से की जा रही है। उनके व्यापक अनुभव का मतलब है कि उन्होंने हर रक्षात्मक रणनीति का सामना किया है। हालाँकि, यह सीज़न संभावित रूप से उनका ""विदाई दौरा"" हो सकता है, जिसमें शीर्ष क्वार्टरबैक के खिलाफ़ मुकाबलों सहित एक चुनौतीपूर्ण कार्यक्रम शामिल है, फिर भी मुख्य प्रश्न यह बना हुआ है कि क्या वह इस साल के बाद भी खेलना जारी रखेंगे। यह शायद एक स्थायी विजेता टीम के साथ एक और लोम्बार्डी ट्रॉफी हासिल करने की इच्छा से प्रेरित होगा।",en,[],,"After an impressive debut for Pittsburgh, how far will veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers lead the Steelers in what could be the four-time MVP's final NFL season?",[''],www.bbc.com/sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But that is not the case everywhere – so what can we learn from those who treat these hallucinations differently? Hearing voices is more common than you might think. Studies through the decades have shown that a surprising number of people without any previously diagnosed mental health condition – often more than three quarters of those taking part – experience voices speaking to them from an unknown source. In Western psychiatry, however, these auditory hallucinations are one of the principal symptoms of psychotic disorders. And the resulting stigma surrounding these mental health conditions means that few people will publicly admit to hearing voices in their head. But in some cultures these hallucinations are not only widely accepted but actively celebrated. They are seen as offering guidance or as helping to keep people safe. What can we learn about mental health from other cultures? And can we see people who experience hearing voices in a different light? Local expectations shaped by the culture, environment and people we grow up with affect whether those who experience hallucinations are judged to be ill, or not, says Tanya Luhrmann, a professor of anthropology from Stanford University in the US, and co-author of the book Our Most Troubling Madness.","Western medicine primarily classifies hearing disembodied voices as a symptom of psychosis and a principal indicator of psychotic disorders. However, this perspective is not universal. A study by the University of California, San Francisco, indicates that hearing voices is more common than widely believed, with a significant number of individuals—often over three-quarters of those surveyed—experiencing such auditory hallucinations without any previously diagnosed mental health condition.

Despite its prevalence, the stigma surrounding these experiences often prevents individuals from admitting to them publicly. Conversely, in some cultures, these hallucinations are not only widely accepted but actively celebrated, seen as sources of guidance, safety, or valuable information. As noted by Tanya Luhrmann, local expectations shaped by culture, environment, and upbringing significantly determine whether an individual's experience of hallucinations is judged as an illness or not, prompting a re-evaluation of how mental health is understood across different societies.","पश्चिमी चिकित्सा मुख्य रूप से शरीर रहित आवाज़ें सुनने को मनोविकृति (psychosis) का एक लक्षण और मनोविकार (psychotic disorders) का एक प्रमुख संकेतक मानती है। हालांकि, यह दृष्टिकोण सार्वभौमिक नहीं है। कैलिफोर्निया विश्वविद्यालय, सैन फ्रांसिस्को (UCSF) के एक अध्ययन से पता चलता है कि आवाज़ें सुनना जितना व्यापक रूप से माना जाता है, उससे कहीं अधिक सामान्य है। इस अध्ययन में सर्वेक्षण किए गए लोगों में से अक्सर तीन-चौथाई से अधिक व्यक्तियों को, बिना किसी पूर्व-निदानित मानसिक स्वास्थ्य स्थिति के, ऐसे श्रवण मतिभ्रम (auditory hallucinations) का अनुभव होता है।

इसकी व्यापकता के बावजूद, इन अनुभवों से जुड़ा कलंक अक्सर व्यक्तियों को इन्हें सार्वजनिक रूप से स्वीकार करने से रोकता है। इसके विपरीत, कुछ संस्कृतियों में, इन मतिभ्रमों को न केवल व्यापक रूप से स्वीकार किया जाता है बल्कि सक्रिय रूप से मनाया भी जाता है, उन्हें मार्गदर्शन, सुरक्षा या मूल्यवान जानकारी के स्रोत के रूप में देखा जाता है। जैसा कि तान्या लुहरमैन ने उल्लेख किया है, संस्कृति, पर्यावरण और पालन-पोषण द्वारा आकारित स्थानीय अपेक्षाएँ यह निर्धारित करने में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाती हैं कि किसी व्यक्ति के मतिभ्रम के अनुभव को बीमारी माना जाता है या नहीं। यह विभिन्न समाजों में मानसिक स्वास्थ्य को कैसे समझा जाता है, इसके पुनर्मूल्यांकन की आवश्यकता पर बल देता है।",en,[],,Western medicine views hearing disembodied voices as a symptom of psychosis.

Here's how the Space Shuttle programme chipped away at one of Nasa's blind spots. On 18 June 1983, Space Shuttle Challenger prepared for launch. STS-7 was Nasa's seventh Shuttle mission for the world's first reusable spacecraft. On board, among its crew of five, was Californian physicist Sally Ride. Until then, only two women had ever been into space. Soviet cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova had made history more than two decades earlier in 1961. Nineteen years later, in 1982, Svetlana Savitskaya became the second woman in space after the Soviets got wind that the US was going to fly its first woman. Although an astronaut Barbie doll appeared in US shops in 1965 – sporting practical boots and a silvery spacesuit – American women had to wait a lot longer for the real thing. By the 1980s both the world and fashion had changed. The revamped 1985 astronaut Barbie sported glittery silver leggings and had a matching handbag. There were fuchsia-pink puffed sleeves, a short skirt and pink knee-length high-heeled boots. While heels were definitely not part of Ride's mission accessories, Nasa did provide cosmetics in the form of mascara, eye shadow and lipstick. They were inside a Personal Preference Kit (PPK) for its six new female astronauts: Ride, Judy Resnik, Anna Fisher, Kathryn Sullivan, Shannon Lucid and Rhea Seddon.","In 1978, NASA heralded a new era of spaceflight by selecting six women among its 35 new astronauts, a significant shift facilitated by the Space Shuttle program. On June 18, 1983, Californian physicist Sally Ride made history as the third woman in space, serving on the five-person crew of Space Shuttle Challenger's STS-7 mission. She followed Soviet cosmonauts Valentina Tereshkova, who became the first woman in space in 1961, and Svetlana Savitskaya, who was the second in 1982.

The article highlights the cultural contrast of the time: while an astronaut Barbie doll evolved from a practical 1965 design to a glamorous, high-heeled 1985 version, NASA prioritized practicality for its real female astronauts. For Ride and the other five pioneering women selected in 1978—Judy Resnik, Anna Fisher, Kathryn Sullivan, Shannon Lucid, and Rhea Seddon—NASA included cosmetics like mascara, eye shadow, and lipstick in their Personal Preference Kits, but notably, no high heels, acknowledging the functional demands of space travel.","यहाँ उस अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

1978 में, नासा ने अपने 35 नए अंतरिक्ष यात्रियों में छह महिलाओं का चयन करके अंतरिक्ष यात्रा के एक नए युग की शुरुआत की। यह स्पेस शटल कार्यक्रम के कारण संभव हुआ एक महत्वपूर्ण बदलाव था। 18 जून 1983 को, कैलिफ़ोर्नियाई भौतिक विज्ञानी सैली राइड ने अंतरिक्ष में जाने वाली तीसरी महिला बनकर इतिहास रच दिया। उन्होंने स्पेस शटल चैलेंजर के एसटीएस-7 मिशन के पाँच सदस्यीय दल में कार्य किया। उनसे पहले सोवियत अंतरिक्ष यात्री वेलेंटीना तेरेश्कोवा (जो 1961 में अंतरिक्ष में जाने वाली पहली महिला बनीं) और स्वेतलाना सवित्स्काया (जो 1982 में दूसरी महिला थीं) अंतरिक्ष में जा चुकी थीं।

Mr Roberts, born in 1829 and the son of a farmer at Groes-bach Farm near Denbigh, took the photograph in 1888, revealing its distinctive spiral structure and mysterious dark lines to a doubting world. He worked as a builder in Liverpool, having moved there aged seven, then spent the latter part of his life as a neighbour of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle at Crowborough in Sussex. But his telescope revealed far more mysteries than Sherlock Holmes could ever have dreamt. Roberts-Klumpke Trust Isaac Roberts demonstrated the spiral structure of galaxies According to W.A. Evans, writing in a 1969 edition of the Denbighshire Historical Society Transactions, Mr Roberts became a Sunday School teacher and ""made strenuous efforts to make up for his early lack of education by attending the Liverpool Mechanics Institute classes in geology, chemistry, electricity and astronomy"". Royal Astronomical Society Isaac Roberts built and observatory in Merseyside, capable of reaching into deep space His early scientific interests were closely related to his profession in the construction industry, presenting geological papers on the drainage of water through sandstone and the difficulties of building on these surfaces. However, as he established himself as a master builder, he gradually found himself with more time to pursue his loftier ambitions. His Rock Ferry observatory near Birkenhead was equipped with a telescope containing a 20"" reflecting mirror made from glass-coated silver, mounted with a 7"" refractor as a tracking scope, attached to a camera which produced images on glass plates. While these components were bought in from other manufacturers, it was a device purely of his own invention which made his photos of the night sky stand out from those which had gone before. Evans wrote: ""The important innovation was a clockwork mechanism which could keep the telescope sighted at the same point in the night sky for 105 minutes. ""This was a most intricate mechanism and resulted in far more accurate observations. The photographs obtained by this method of sighting showed 1,270 stars in the North Pole cluster, compared to the 38 in previous photographs."" The 105 minutes was the key figure, as this was the amount of time it took for photographic images to be exposed onto the glass panels available to Mr Roberts at the time. Stephen Eales, professor of astronomy at Cardiff University, said this contraption was the first to solve a problem which scientists still wrestle with to this day. ""The advantage of photography over the naked eye is that light can accumulate on film over time, allowing objects to be seen in far more detail than in just one snapshot. ""However the down side is that the Earth is rotating so quickly that in a matter of seconds you will have lost your focus on the target. ""Nowadays telescopes are programmed by computer to counteract the Earth's rotation, but to have come up with a mechanical solution to this problem so early was revolutionary."" Cardiff University/European Space Agency In 2010 Prof Eales' team built a camera onboard the William Herschel Space Observatory, which captured the very same image as Isaac Roberts had 122 years before. The observatory - in Earth's orbit, four times more distant than the moon - only lasted from 2009 - 2013, before the helium cylinders required to cool it to near absolute zero ran out Prof Eales first became interested in Mr Roberts when writing his own book The Ghost in The Telescope, on how his team had observed the same Andromeda Galaxy through the William Herschel Space Observatory in 2010. ""We were investigating Andromeda in the submillimetre waveband, between infrared and radio waves - that allowed us to see what causes the dark lines visible in Roberts' photos, which many had written off as imperfections in his exposure. ""In the visible wavelengths you can only see a 'stellar bulge' of old stars, but the newly-born stars are masked by interstellar dust."" Prof Eales likened it to looking at a bonfire through its smoke. ""The new stars are there, glowing blue as opposed to the older stars' red, but Isaac couldn't picture them because they were masked by the 'smoke' of their creation. We were able to prove their existence by measuring the tiny difference in radiation between the dark lines Isaac photographed and the space around them."" Science Museum, London Installed first at his home near Liverpool, Roberts' telescope was later moved to the less smoky skies of Crowborogh, Sussex Prof Eales believes it was the collision of photography and astronomy during the late 19th Century which made this all possible. ""People had been staring into space for centuries, but without a means of recording what they'd seen, it was impossible to cross-check their findings. ""Isaac, along with Edward Emerson Barnard in America, were amongst the first to put the disciplines together. ""Barnard was a brilliant self-taught photographer who'd been forced into work at the age of six through poverty, and Isaac had mastery of the skies. It was by people like this coming together and sharing their knowhow that we have the foundations upon which research like ours with the William Herschel Space Observatory were built."" Cambridge University Press Roberts' 'Starfield' home, where he lived cheek by jowl with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but did he ever detect the dog who barked in the night? Shortly after his groundbreaking 1888 photograph Roberts relocated to Sussex to escape Liverpool's pollution; partly owing to his chronic bronchitis, and partly in search of clearer skies. In the village of Crowborough he would almost certainly have rubbed shoulders with neighbour Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, though no documentary evidence has been found that the two were familiar. In 1896 he was a member of the party who went to Vadso in Norway to observe the total eclipse of the sun, where he met his future second wife Dr Dorothea Klumpke of the Paris Observatory. Roberts-Klumpke Trust 32 years his his junior, Dorothea was by Roberts' side throughout the latter years of his life, from 1896 to 1904","Isaac Roberts, a 19th-century builder and self-taught astronomer, is celebrated for capturing the first clear photograph of the Andromeda galaxy in 1888. His groundbreaking work also demonstrated the spiral structure of galaxies, a significant advancement in astronomy.

Roberts, who compensated for an early lack of formal education through self-study, achieved this through his innovative clockwork mechanism. Integrated into his observatory's telescope in Rock Ferry, Merseyside, this device allowed the telescope to track the night sky for up to 105 minutes, enabling long photographic exposures on glass panels. This technique accumulated light, revealing far more celestial detail, such as 1,270 stars in the North Pole cluster compared to previous methods' 38.

Experts like Professor Stephen Eales of Cardiff University highlight Roberts' mechanism as revolutionary, solving the persistent problem of Earth's rotation in astrophotography long before computer-controlled telescopes existed. Roberts essentially merged the nascent fields of photography and astronomy, laying foundations for future research. In 2010, Professor Eales' team even used the William Herschel Space Observatory to replicate Roberts' Andromeda image, studying the 'dark lines' (interstellar dust masking new stars) that Roberts' photographs revealed but couldn't fully explain.

Roberts later moved from Liverpool due to chronic bronchitis and pollution to Crowborough, Sussex, seeking clearer skies, where he was a neighbour to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He met his second wife, Dr. Dorothea Klumpke of the Paris Observatory, during a solar eclipse observation in Norway.","यहाँ अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

आइजैक रॉबर्ट्स, जो 19वीं सदी के एक बिल्डर और स्व-शिक्षित खगोलशास्त्री थे, को 1888 में एंड्रोमेडा आकाशगंगा की पहली स्पष्ट तस्वीर खींचने के लिए जाना जाता है। उनके इस अभूतपूर्व कार्य ने आकाशगंगाओं की सर्पिल संरचना को भी प्रदर्शित किया, जो खगोल विज्ञान में एक महत्वपूर्ण प्रगति थी।

औपचारिक शिक्षा की प्रारंभिक कमी को स्व-अध्ययन से पूरा करते हुए, रॉबर्ट्स ने यह उपलब्धि अपने अभिनव घड़ीनुमा यांत्रिक तंत्र के माध्यम से हासिल की। मर्सीसाइड के रॉक फेरी में स्थित उनकी वेधशाला के दूरबीन में एकीकृत, इस उपकरण ने दूरबीन को 105 मिनट तक रात के आकाश को ट्रैक करने की अनुमति दी। इससे कांच के पैनल पर लंबी फोटोग्राफिक एक्सपोजर लेना संभव हो पाया। इस तकनीक से प्रकाश संचित होता गया, जिसने कहीं अधिक खगोलीय विवरण उजागर किए, जैसे कि उत्तरी ध्रुव क्लस्टर में 1,270 तारे, जबकि पिछली विधियों से केवल 38 ही दिखाई देते थे।

कार्डिफ विश्वविद्यालय के प्रोफेसर स्टीफन ईल्स जैसे विशेषज्ञ रॉबर्ट्स के तंत्र को क्रांतिकारी बताते हैं, जिसने कंप्यूटर-नियंत्रित दूरबीनों के अस्तित्व में आने से बहुत पहले ही खगोल-फोटोग्राफी में पृथ्वी के घूर्णन की लगातार बनी रहने वाली समस्या का समाधान कर दिया था। रॉबर्ट्स ने मूल रूप से फोटोग्राफी और खगोल विज्ञान के उभरते हुए क्षेत्रों का विलय किया, जिससे भविष्य के अनुसंधान के लिए नींव पड़ी। 2010 में, प्रोफेसर ईल्स की टीम ने विलियम हर्शेल स्पेस ऑब्जर्वेटरी का उपयोग करके रॉबर्ट्स की एंड्रोमेडा छवि को दोहराया और उन 'गहरी रेखाओं' (अंतरतारकीय धूल जो नए तारों को छिपाती है) का अध्ययन किया, जिन्हें रॉबर्ट्स की तस्वीरों ने उजागर किया था लेकिन वे पूरी तरह से समझा नहीं पाए थे।

बाद में, पुरानी ब्रोंकाइटिस और प्रदूषण के कारण रॉबर्ट्स लिवरपूल से क्रोबोरो, ससेक्स चले गए, स्वच्छ आकाश की तलाश में, जहां वे सर आर्थर कोनन डॉयल के पड़ोसी थे। उन्होंने अपनी दूसरी पत्नी, पेरिस वेधशाला की डॉ. डोरोथिया क्लुम्प्के से नॉर्वे में एक सूर्य ग्रहण के अवलोकन के दौरान मुलाकात की।",en,[],,"Isaac Roberts, a farmer's son from Denbigh, shocked the world with his intergalactic photos.",[''],www.bbc.com/innovation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chris Wright told me in an interview that he expected the technology to deliver power to electricity grids around the world within eight to 15 years and that it would rapidly become a big driver of greenhouse gas reductions. His claims will likely surprise even enthusiasts for the technology. Harnessing the energy released when atoms fuse together could produce vast amounts of low carbon energy but most scientists believe commercial fusion power plants are still a long way off. ""With artificial intelligence and what's going on at the national labs and private companies in the United States, we will have that approach about how to harness fusion energy multiple ways within the next five years,"" said Mr Wright. ""The technology, it'll be on the electric grid, you know, in eight to 15 years."" Scientists believe nuclear fusion, which Mr Wright studied at university, could one day produce vast amounts of energy without heating up our atmosphere. But it's a very complex process. Replicating it on Earth involves heating atoms to temperatures many times hotter than the sun. President Donald Trump's controversial energy chief also urged the UK government to lift the de facto ban on fracking and issue new oil and gas licenses in the North Sea. The US Energy Secretary warned the Trump Administration had ""serious concerns"" about Europe's reliance on Chinese renewable technologies. ""It looks like the Chinese could control what's going on with your energy system,"" he said. He repeated the claims made by Donald Trump that the UK and Europe's effort to transition away from fossil fuels to low carbon energy is driving deindustrialisation and impoverishing their citizens. Mr Wright is in Brussels ahead of Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK next week. The US President will meet Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and will attend a banquet hosted by King Charles at Windsor Castle. Getty Images China leads the world in solar technology and exports but the Trump administration has ""serious concerns"" about Europe's reliance on its renewable technologies During the BBC interview the US Energy Secretary said fracking – releasing oil and gas trapped rock formations underground - could have a ""tremendous"" impact on the UK economy. Mr Wright, who has founded and run fracking companies in the US, suggested the oil and gas the process would produce could ""bring back manufacturing and blue-collar jobs and drive down not just electricity prices, but home-heating prices and industrial energy prices"". Reform UK recently said it would encourage fracking in the UK if it were to win the next election, but the British Geological Survey has warned the potential for the technology to produce large amounts of oil and gas in the UK is likely to be limited. Mr Wright defended the billions of dollars of cuts the Trump Administration has made to renewable energy subsidies. He said wind power has been subsidised for 33 years and solar for 25 years. ""Isn't that enough?"" the Energy Secretary asked: ""You've got to be able to walk on your own after 25 to 30 years of subsidies."" Getty Images US Energy Secretary Chris Wright stands behind President Donald Trump as he holds an executive order The Energy Secretary also stood by the report issued by the Department of Energy in July which said the threat of climate change has been exaggerated. Among a series of controversial claims, the report said sea level rise is not accelerating, that computer models of the climate exaggerate future temperature rises and that climate scientists overlook beneficial aspects of climate change like the fact that high densities of carbon dioxide promote plant growth. Earlier this month more than 85 international scientists claimed it was riddled with errors and misrepresentations and that data had been ""cherry-picked"" - selectively chosen. The scientists also called into question the academic standards of the five authors of the paper. Mr Wright told the BBC he believes it is climate scientists who use data selectively. ""Cherry-picking data in climate science, in the media, by activists and by politicians is the norm,"" he said. He acknowledged that climate change is a ""very real, physical phenomenon"" and said that he believes the world will decarbonise: ""It's just generations from now, not two or three decades from now."" He said he was delighted his report had prompted such vigorous debate: ""We've got a dialogue back and forth about climate change in a public forum. I've wanted that for 20 years."" He denied that the cuts the Trump Administration is making to climate science, including a proposal to slash the funding for the US's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), would damage US research into weather and climate. There has been speculation that the cuts could block the development of the next generation of weather satellites and could even lead to the closure of the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, which is responsible for the longest record of direct measurements of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. ""There are a lot of rumours about all sorts of terrible things happening,"" said Mr Wright, who claimed the US government is trying to restore ""real science"". He claimed: ""One of the problems of science is it's become so politicised in the climate world, if you deviate from the church, your funding gets cut off.""","US Energy Secretary Chris Wright made a series of significant claims to the BBC, most notably predicting that nuclear fusion could power global electricity grids within a remarkably optimistic 8 to 15 years, with multiple harnessing methods available in five years. This timeline is considerably more aggressive than most scientific projections for commercial fusion.

In the wide-ranging interview, Wright also urged the UK government to lift its de facto ban on fracking and issue new North Sea oil and gas licenses, arguing it could significantly boost the British economy. He expressed ""serious concerns"" about Europe's reliance on Chinese renewable technologies, suggesting a risk of Chinese control over energy systems, and defended the Trump administration's cuts to renewable energy subsidies, asserting these technologies have received sufficient support over decades.

Furthermore, Wright supported a controversial Department of Energy report that claims the threat of climate change has been exaggerated, denying accelerating sea-level rise and challenging computer models of future temperature rises. He accused climate scientists, media, and activists of ""cherry-picking"" data, while acknowledging climate change as a ""very real, physical phenomenon"" but believing decarbonization would occur over generations, not immediate decades. He dismissed concerns that cuts to climate science funding would harm US research, stating the aim is to restore ""real science"" from a politicized field.

Wright's comments were made in Brussels ahead of President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK.","अमेरिकी ऊर्जा सचिव क्रिस राइट ने बीबीसी से बातचीत में कई महत्वपूर्ण दावे किए, जिनमें सबसे उल्लेखनीय भविष्यवाणी यह थी कि परमाणु संलयन (nuclear fusion) 8 से 15 साल के भीतर वैश्विक बिजली ग्रिड को बिजली दे सकता है, जो एक उल्लेखनीय रूप से आशावादी समय-सीमा है। उनका कहना था कि पांच साल में इसे उपयोग में लाने के कई तरीके उपलब्ध होंगे। यह समय-सीमा वाणिज्यिक संलयन (commercial fusion) के लिए अधिकांश वैज्ञानिक अनुमानों की तुलना में काफी अधिक आक्रामक है।

इस व्यापक साक्षात्कार में, राइट ने ब्रिटिश सरकार से फ्रैकिंग (fracking) पर लगे उसके वास्तविक प्रतिबंध (de facto ban) को हटाने और उत्तरी सागर (North Sea) के नए तेल और गैस लाइसेंस जारी करने का आग्रह भी किया, यह तर्क देते हुए कि इससे ब्रिटिश अर्थव्यवस्था को काफी बढ़ावा मिल सकता है। उन्होंने यूरोपीय देशों की चीनी अक्षय ऊर्जा प्रौद्योगिकियों पर निर्भरता के बारे में ""गंभीर चिंताएँ"" व्यक्त कीं, यह सुझाव देते हुए कि इससे ऊर्जा प्रणालियों पर चीनी नियंत्रण का जोखिम हो सकता है। उन्होंने ट्रम्प प्रशासन द्वारा अक्षय ऊर्जा सब्सिडी में की गई कटौती का भी बचाव किया, यह दावा करते हुए कि इन प्रौद्योगिकियों को दशकों से पर्याप्त समर्थन मिला है।

इसके अलावा, राइट ने ऊर्जा विभाग (Department of Energy) की एक विवादास्पद रिपोर्ट का समर्थन किया, जिसमें दावा किया गया है कि जलवायु परिवर्तन के खतरे को बढ़ा-चढ़ाकर पेश किया गया है। उन्होंने समुद्र के बढ़ते स्तर (accelerating sea-level rise) से इनकार किया और भविष्य के तापमान वृद्धि के कंप्यूटर मॉडल को चुनौती दी। उन्होंने जलवायु वैज्ञानिकों, मीडिया और कार्यकर्ताओं पर डेटा को ""अपनी पसंद से चुनने (cherry-picking)"" का आरोप लगाया, जबकि उन्होंने जलवायु परिवर्तन को ""एक बहुत ही वास्तविक, भौतिक घटना"" के रूप में स्वीकार किया, लेकिन उनका मानना था कि डीकार्बोनाइजेशन (decarbonization) तत्काल दशकों के बजाय पीढ़ियों तक चलेगा। उन्होंने इस चिंता को खारिज कर दिया कि जलवायु विज्ञान के वित्तपोषण में कटौती से अमेरिकी अनुसंधान को नुकसान होगा, यह कहते हुए कि इसका उद्देश्य एक राजनीतिक क्षेत्र से ""वास्तविक विज्ञान"" को बहाल करना है।

The mudstones, found in a dusty riverbed by Nasa's Perseverance Rover, are dotted with intriguing markings nicknamed leopard spots and poppy seeds.

""We have found features in the rocks that if you saw them on Earth could be explained by biology - by microbial process. So we're not saying that we found life, but we're saying that it really gives us something to chase."" ""It's like seeing a leftover fossil. Maybe it was a leftover meal, maybe that meal's been excreted and that's what we're seeing here,"" Dr Nicola Fox, Nasa's Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate, said in at the press conference. The only way to fully confirm if the minerals were made by microbes would be to bring the rocks back to Earth for analysis . A Mars sample return mission has been proposed by Nasa and Esa but its future looks highly uncertain. The US Space Agency's science budget is facing huge cuts that have been put forward in President Trump's 2026 budget and a sample return mission is one of those facing cancellation. Today, Mars is a cold and arid desert. But billions of years ago there is evidence that it had a thick atmosphere and water, making it a promising place to look for past life. The Perseverance Rover, which touched down on the Martian surface in 2021, was sent to search for signs of biology. It has spent the last four years exploring a region called the Jezero Crater, which was once an ancient lake with a river flowing into it. The rover found the leopard print rocks last year at the bottom of a canyon carved out by the river in an area called the Bright Angel Formation. They are about 3.5bn years old and are a type of rock called mudstone, which is fine-grained rock formed from clays. ""We kind of immediately knew there was some interesting chemistry that had happened in these rocks so we were pretty excited right away,"" said Joel Hurowitz from Stony Brook University in New York, who is also a Perseverance mission scientist and lead author of the paper. The rover used several instruments in its onboard lab to analyse the minerals in the rocks. This data was then beamed back to Earth for scientists to study. ""We think what we've found is evidence for a set of chemical reactions that took place in the mud that was deposited at the bottom of a lake - and those chemical reactions seem to have taken place between the mud itself and organic matter - and those two ingredients reacted to form new minerals,"" explained Dr Hurowitz. In similar conditions on Earth, chemical reactions creating minerals are typically driven by microbes. ""That is one of the possible explanations for how these features came to be in these rocks,"" said Dr Hurowitz. ""This feels like the most compelling potential biosignature detection that we've had to date."" Where we might find aliens in the next decade The scientists have also examined how the minerals could have formed without microbes - and concluded that natural geological processes could also be behind the chemical reactions. However they would require high temperatures, and the rocks don't look like they've been heated. ""We found some difficulties for the non-biological pathways - but we can't rule them out completely,"" Dr Hurowitz said. NASA/JPL Perseverance has collected samples of the intriguing rocks","## Mars Rover Discovers ""Clearest Sign Yet"" of Potential Ancient Life in ""Leopard-Spot"" Rocks

The 3.5-billion-year-old mudstones, found in an ancient riverbed in the Bright Angel Formation, feature distinctive markings nicknamed ""leopard spots"" and ""poppy seeds."" Scientists believe these features contain minerals produced by chemical reactions, which on Earth, are often associated with microbial processes. While natural geological processes could also create these minerals, they would typically require high temperatures not evident in the rocks, making a non-biological origin less likely.

Experts are cautiously optimistic. Professor Sanjeev Gupta, a planetary scientist from Imperial College London, stated, ""We have found features in the rocks that if you saw them on Earth could be explained by biology – by microbial process.""

ब्राइट एंजल फॉर्मेशन में एक प्राचीन नदी तल में पाए गए, 3.5 अरब साल पुराने इन मडस्टोन्स में ""तेंदुए के धब्बे"" और ""खसखस के दाने"" जैसे विशिष्ट निशान हैं। वैज्ञानिकों का मानना है कि इन विशेषताओं में रासायनिक प्रतिक्रियाओं से उत्पन्न खनिज होते हैं, जो पृथ्वी पर अक्सर सूक्ष्मजीवी प्रक्रियाओं (माइक्रोबियल प्रोसेस) से जुड़े होते हैं। हालांकि, प्राकृतिक भूवैज्ञानिक प्रक्रियाएं भी इन खनिजों को बना सकती हैं, लेकिन उनके लिए आमतौर पर उच्च तापमान की आवश्यकता होती है, जो इन चट्टानों में स्पष्ट नहीं है, जिससे एक गैर-जैविक उत्पत्ति कम संभावित लगती है।

विशेषज्ञ सावधानीपूर्वक आशावादी हैं। इंपीरियल कॉलेज लंदन के एक ग्रह वैज्ञानिक, प्रोफेसर संजीव गुप्ता ने कहा, ""हमने चट्टानों में ऐसी विशेषताएं पाई हैं, जिन्हें यदि आप पृथ्वी पर देखते, तो उन्हें जीव विज्ञान – यानी सूक्ष्मजीवी प्रक्रियाओं द्वारा समझाया जा सकता था।"" स्टोनी ब्रुक यूनिवर्सिटी के जोएल हुरोविट्ज़ ने इसे ""अब तक की सबसे आकर्षक संभावित बायोसिग्नेचर (जैविक संकेत) पहचान"" बताया है।

Luckily you can also get them into better shape. How old do you think your lungs are? With every breath, they are exposed to a myriad of pollutants, microbes, dust and allergens. Unsurprisingly this can take a toll on these delicate organs, accelerating how they age. But they also can affect how the rest of your body ages too. In early May 2025, an international team of respiratory experts published one of the first ever studies to assess how human lung function varies as we age. Based on data from some 30,000 men and women collected over the course of the 20th Century, it showed that our lung function peaks in our early to mid-20s. Women's lung capacity typically tops out a few years earlier than men's – before declining thereafter. This, according to Judith Garcia-Aymerich, a professor at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health who led the study, appears to be a biologically programmed part of ageing, she says. Factors such as smoking, air pollution and flare-ups of conditions like asthma can all exacerbate this decline. The better your lung capacity is at this peak age, however, the more resilience you will have against chronic respiratory diseases and other lung-related health conditions later in life, says Garcia-Aymerich. But lung health is also linked to a wide range of other more surprising aspects of your health, affecting your immune system, your weight and even your brain (read on to find out why later in this piece).","The health of our lungs serves as a critical indicator of overall well-being and can be actively improved. Constantly exposed to pollutants, microbes, and allergens, lungs endure wear and tear that accelerates their aging and, consequently, the aging of the entire body.

This process was further detailed in an international study published in early May 2025. Analyzing data from approximately 30,000 individuals, the research established that human lung function typically peaks between the early to mid-20s, with women's capacity reaching its zenith a few years sooner than men's. This subsequent decline is identified as a biologically programmed aspect of aging, though it is significantly worsened by factors like smoking, air pollution, and asthma flare-ups.

Maintaining a robust lung capacity at its peak provides greater protection against chronic respiratory diseases later in life. Beyond respiratory health, strong lung function is surprisingly connected to other crucial aspects of health, including the immune system, weight management, and brain function.","यहाँ अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

हमारे फेफड़ों का स्वास्थ्य समग्र कल्याण का एक महत्वपूर्ण संकेतक है और इसे सक्रिय रूप से बेहतर बनाया जा सकता है। प्रदूषकों, रोगाणुओं और एलर्जन के लगातार संपर्क में रहने के कारण, फेफड़ों को टूट-फूट का सामना करना पड़ता है, जिससे उनकी और फलस्वरूप पूरे शरीर की उम्र बढ़ने की प्रक्रिया तेज हो जाती है।

इस प्रक्रिया का मई 2025 की शुरुआत में प्रकाशित एक अंतरराष्ट्रीय अध्ययन में विस्तार से वर्णन किया गया था। लगभग 30,000 व्यक्तियों के आंकड़ों का विश्लेषण करने पर, शोध में बताया गया कि मानव फेफड़ों की कार्यक्षमता आमतौर पर 20 के दशक की शुरुआत से मध्य तक चरम पर होती है, जिसमें महिलाओं की क्षमता पुरुषों की तुलना में कुछ साल पहले अपने शिखर पर पहुँच जाती है। इस बाद की गिरावट को उम्र बढ़ने का एक जैविक रूप से निर्धारित पहलू माना गया है, हालांकि धूम्रपान, वायु प्रदूषण और अस्थमा के दौरे जैसे कारकों से यह काफी बिगड़ जाती है।

अपने चरम पर फेफड़ों की मजबूत क्षमता बनाए रखने से बाद के जीवन में पुरानी श्वसन संबंधी बीमारियों से अधिक सुरक्षा मिलती है। श्वसन स्वास्थ्य के अलावा, फेफड़ों की मजबूत कार्यक्षमता आश्चर्यजनक रूप से स्वास्थ्य के अन्य महत्वपूर्ण पहलुओं से भी जुड़ी हुई है, जिसमें प्रतिरक्षा प्रणाली, वजन प्रबंधन और मस्तिष्क का कार्य शामिल है।",en,[],,The condition of our lungs can reveal a great deal about our wider health.

It is easy to wax lyrical about aliens. The prospect of life on other planets has shaped much of our culture and continues to inspire books, TV shows, movies – and the odd conspiracy theory of course. But amongst all the fantastical visions of little green men there is a real, actual hunt for alien life taking place right now, and it is not some fringe science or controversial idea. It is a systematic process that scientists are undertaking, with results expected in as little as a decade. To be more exact, there are multiple hunts for alien life currently underway. On Mars, a rover is collecting samples that may determine if life ever existed on the red planet. Probes are visiting some of our solar system's icy moons to search for signs of habitability. Astronomers are also beginning to scour the atmospheres of planets beyond our own solar system for telltale elemental cocktails that hint at alien life. And, yes, we are even keeping a beady eye out for signals from any intelligent civilisation that might purposefully – or accidentally – make contact. ""I think in 10 years we'll have some evidence about whether there's anything organic on some nearby planets,"" says Lord Martin Rees, the UK astronomer royal. ""I think we are really [on the cusp]."" Alien life, if it exists, has not made itself easily known. Early attempts to search for extraterrestrial intelligence, called Seti, began in the mid-20th Century, with astronomers looking in vain for radio signals on other planets. Mars, which was believed in the late 19th Century to have life-harbouring canals and rivers, was discovered to be a mostly dry, barren wasteland. Planets around other stars, meanwhile, were so small that finding them was difficult, let alone learning much about them.","Scientists are engaged in a serious and systematic global hunt for alien life, distinguishing their efforts from popular culture's fictional UFOs and abductions. This real scientific endeavor, expected to yield results within a decade, involves multiple approaches.

Current methods include the Curiosity rover collecting samples on Mars to determine if life ever existed on the Red Planet, probes exploring our solar system's icy moons for signs of habitability, and astronomers scouring exoplanet atmospheres for chemical indicators of life. Additionally, researchers continue to monitor for signals from any intelligent civilizations through efforts like SETI.

Lord Martin Rees, the UK Astronomer Royal, predicts that evidence of organic material on nearby planets could emerge within 10 years, stating we are ""on the cusp of something really special."" While early attempts, such as mid-20th-century SETI searches and debunked theories of Martian canals, proved fruitless, and exoplanets were initially challenging to study, current advancements mark a new, optimistic era in the search for extraterrestrial life.","वैज्ञानिक परग्रही जीवन की गंभीर और व्यवस्थित वैश्विक खोज में लगे हुए हैं, अपने प्रयासों को लोकप्रिय संस्कृति के काल्पनिक यूएफओ और अपहरण की कहानियों से अलग कर रहे हैं। इस वास्तविक वैज्ञानिक प्रयास से, जिससे एक दशक के भीतर परिणाम मिलने की उम्मीद है, में कई दृष्टिकोण शामिल हैं।

The company, owned by India's Tata Motors, initially said it did not believe any customer information had been stolen Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has admitted that some data may have been taken by hackers in a cyber-attack that has halted car production and forced the vehicle-maker to send workers home. Production lines at JLR's factories in Solihull, Halewood and Wolverhampton have been at a standstill since the beginning of last week. A group calling itself Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, which was behind this year's cyber- attacks on UK retailers including M&S, has claimed responsibility for the JLR hack. Last week, the Information Commissioners Office told the BBC that JLR had reported an incident to the UK's data watchdog. In a new statement, JLR said on Wednesday: ""As a result of our ongoing investigation, we now believe that some data has been affected and we are informing the relevant regulators. ""Our forensic investigation continues at pace and we will contact anyone as appropriate if we find that their data has been impacted."" However, Ciaran Martin, a professor at the University of Oxford and the former boss of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), said data isn't really the issue for a company like JLR - it is more important that the firm can keep operating and making cars. He told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There's a real difference between somebody breaking into your house when you're not there or when you're asleep and maybe photocopying your bank records and your medical records and using that to defraud you. ""There's a real difference between that and being punched in the face and having your legs broken."" Prof Martin said that ""the law right now tells companies to protect customer data as your number one priority"" but said that securing a firm's operation was just as important. M&S's operation was impacted by a cyber-attack for a number of months this year, stopping customers from ordering online and costing the High Street retailer £300m. JLR shut down its IT networks in response to the attack. The company said it is ""working around the clock"", to restart its IT systems but doing so is understood to be a highly complex process. The NCSC, which is part of GCHQ, is assisting JLR. Chris Bryant, the newly-appointed business minister, told MPs on Tuesday that the government was ""engaging with JLR on a daily basis to understand the challenges that the company and its suppliers are facing"". Local MPs have been invited to a half-hour question and answer session with the company on Friday.","Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed that a recent cyberattack has compromised some of its data, after initially stating no customer information was believed stolen.

The company has declined to specify whose data (e.g., customers or suppliers) has been impacted but is informing relevant regulators and conducting a forensic investigation. The cyberattack has been claimed by ""Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters,"" a group also responsible for previous breaches against UK retailers like M&S, which reportedly cost M&S £300 million and impacted its online operations for months.

JLR responded by shutting down its IT networks and is working ""around the clock"" on the complex process of restarting them. Ciaran Martin, an Oxford University professor, highlighted that for a company like JLR, ensuring operational continuity and the ability to manufacture cars is as critical as protecting customer data.

लेखक एंडी सॉन्डर्स ने इन तस्वीरों को डिजिटल रूप से पुनर्स्थापित करने में हज़ारों घंटे बारीकी से खर्च किए हैं। जेमिनी और मर्करी अंतरिक्ष मिशनों के पहले से कम उजागर (underexposed) फिल्म फुटेज से स्कैन की गई ये तस्वीरें दशकों से नासा के अभिलेखागार में दबी हुई थीं। सॉन्डर्स को उम्मीद है कि ये पुनर्स्थापित तस्वीरें ""इस अविश्वसनीय युग पर प्रकाश डालेंगी"", और उनका वर्णन करते हुए कहते हैं कि ये इतनी ""अत्यंत व्यक्तिगत"" हैं कि दर्शकों को ""उनके साथ अंतरिक्ष यान में होने"" का एहसास कराती हैं।

But the story did not generate the traction the Reach newspapers would have expected a year ago, or even at the start of the year. Reach put this down to AI Overviews (AIO) – the AI summary at the top of the Google results page. Instead of clicking through to the story on a Reach newspaper site, readers were happy with the AI overview. The feature is a concern for newspapers and other media publishers, who have already seen much of their advertising revenue siphoned off by social media. In a tough market, readers coming via Google search is a valuable source of traffic. ""A major worry, backed by some individual datapoints, has been that AI overviews would lead to fewer people clicking through to the content behind them, with negative knock-on effects for publishers,"" says Dr Felix Simon, research fellow in AI and news at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, University of Oxford. He points out that it's hard to know the full effect of AI overviews, without independent access to Google's, or publishers', internal data on click-through rates. DMG Media, owner of MailOnline, Metro and other outlets, said AIO resulted in a fall in click-through-rates by as much as 89%, in a statement to the Competition and Markets Authority made in July. It means publishers are not being fairly rewarded for their work, says David Higgerson, chief digital publisher at Reach. ""Publishers provide the accurate, timely, trustworthy content that basically fuels Google, and in return we get a click… that hopefully we can monetise to our subscription service. ""Now with Google Overviews it's reducing the need for somebody to click through to us in the first place, but for no financial benefit for the publisher."" ""It's another example of the distributor of information not being the creator of information but taking all the financial reward for it."" There is also concern over Google's new tool called AI Mode, which shows search results in a conversational style with far fewer links than traditional search. ""If Google flips onto full AI Mode, and there is a big uptake in that…that [will be] completely quite devastating for the industry,"" says Mr Higgerson. Getty Images The Daily Mail has one of the UK's biggest online news operations ""We are definitely moving into the era of lower clicks and lower referral traffic for publishers,"" says Stuart Forrest, global director of SEO digital publishing at Bauer Media. ""For most of the last decade Google has introduced more and more features into the SERP [Search Engine Results Page], which reduces the need for consumers to visit a website. That is the challenge that we as a sector face."" Mr Forrest says he hasn't noticed a drop in traffic across Bauer's sites, which include brands Grazia and Empire, as a result of the overview feature. But that could change. ""I absolutely think that as time goes on, as consumers get used to these panels, it's without doubt going to be a challenge. We are absolutely behaving as if we have to respond to that threat."" In its defence, a Google spokesperson said: ""More than any other company, Google prioritises sending traffic to the web, and we continue to send billions of clicks to websites every day. In an August blog post, Google's head of search Liz Reid said the volume of clicks from Google search to websites had been ""relatively stable"" year-over-year. She also said the number of quality of clicks had improved slightly compared to a year ago - quality clicks are when a user does not immediately click back from the link. ""With AI Overviews, people are searching more and asking new questions that are often longer and more complex. In addition, with AI Overviews people are seeing more links on the page than before. More queries and more links mean more opportunities for websites to surface and get clicked,"" she said in the blog. Publishers are trying to work out how to appear in Google summaries Some in the publishing industry are turning to the courts for redress. In July, a group of organisations including the Independent Publishers Alliance, tech justice non-profit Foxglove, and the campaign group Movement for an Open Web filed a legal complaint to the UK's Competition and Markets Authority alleging that Google AI Overviews is using publishers' content at a cost to the newspapers. It is asking the CMA to introduce interim measures to prevent Google from ""misusing"" publisher content in AI-generated responses.","News publishers are expressing significant alarm over Google's AI Overviews (AIO) and its emerging ""AI Mode,"" contending these features are causing a substantial decline in online traffic and advertising revenue. Publishers like Reach have observed that AI-generated summaries at the top of Google search results often satisfy users, eliminating the need to click through to original articles. DMG Media has even reported a drastic 89% fall in click-through rates for some stories.

Publishers accuse Google of unfairly profiting from their costly content, which fuels these AI summaries, without providing adequate compensation or referral traffic, thereby exacerbating their already challenging business model. They warn that a full ""AI Mode,"" which offers conversational search results with fewer links, could be ""devastating"" for the industry.

Google, however, defends its AI features, asserting its commitment to sending billions of clicks to websites daily and claiming overall click volume remains stable with improved quality. Google also argues that AI Overviews enable more complex user queries and create new opportunities for websites to be discovered and clicked.

In response, publishers are exploring adaptive strategies while also pursuing legal action. A coalition, including the Independent Publishers Alliance, has filed a complaint with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, seeking interim measures to prevent Google from misusing publisher content in its AI responses without proper remuneration.","यहाँ अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद दिया गया है:

Sunscreen doesn't take 20 minutes to 'activate' Most sunscreen labels say sunscreen should be applied 15-20 minutes before exposure. But that doesn't mean sunscreen is ineffective during the wait. In fact, studies have shown that sunscreens can be effective immediately, something many manufacturers also say. Instead, 15-20 minutes gives the formulation enough time to dry into a consistent, protective ""film"" that's harder to smear, or to sweat or wash off, notes Michelle Wong, chemist and author of the book The Science of Beauty, who frequently tackles sunscreen myths online. Fifteen minutes may actually be a conservative estimate for how much time that takes, with one small study finding that the sunscreen tested created this film after just eight minutes. Still, following the manufacturer's instructions is always better. 9. It is untrue that people with darker skin don't need to worry about UV radiation The melanin in darker-toned skin provides some natural protection from UV, which is why melanoma incidence tends to be much less in black populations than fair-skinned ones. However, people with darker skin tones can still get both sunburns and skin cancer, and Sun exposure can cause them to develop hyperpigmentation disorders like melasma – which is part of why dermatologists like Sommerlad recommend that people with all skin tones use sun protection.

No, sunscreen is not causing skin cancer rates to go up Rates of melanoma are on the rise among light-skinned people in countries like the US, UK and Australia, but that doesn't mean that sunscreen is the cause. For one, cancers of all kinds are more likely among older populations and populations in these countries are ageing. We also know that the more frequently someone sunburns or uses tanning beds, the greater their risk of skin cancer – and both sunbathing and tanning have been particularly popular over the last few decades. One study of skin cancers in Australia found that around two-thirds of melanomas and ""essentially all"" basal and squamous cell carcinomas result specifically from UV exposure, while a study on all patients diagnosed with melanoma in Sweden between 1960 and 2004 found that melanomas were most likely to be on the torso and limbs for people under 70 – indicating that UV exposure was a main cause. ""If you're health conscious and want to protect your longevity and your health, then protecting yourself from sunburns is one of the best things you can do,"" says Sommerlad. But there is one roundabout way in which sunscreen might have led to an increase in skin cancer, experts note: it can make us feel invincible. ""When people put on a sunscreen, they think they've got this invisible barrier against the Sun on themselves, and they tend to change their behaviour and spend more time in the Sun,"" says Diffey. ""But I don't believe that sunscreens per se are carcinogenic."" -- For trusted insights into better health and wellbeing rooted in science, sign up to the Health Fix newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights.

Prolonged sun exposure causes DNA damage without continually boosting Vitamin D3, and sunscreen use has not been linked to Vitamin D deficiency.

Regarding sunscreen application, it is effective immediately upon contact; the recommended 15-20 minute wait period allows the product to dry into a durable, protective film, not for ""activation,"" though this film can form even faster. Users should always adhere to manufacturer instructions. For natural shade, dense, tall trees are recommended.

The article also dispels the myth that darker skin tones are immune to UV damage. While melanin offers some natural protection, individuals with darker skin are still susceptible to sunburn, skin cancer, and hyperpigmentation, underscoring the universal need for sun protection.

Furthermore, sunscreen is not responsible for rising skin cancer rates. The increase in melanoma, particularly among light-skinned populations, is primarily attributed to aging demographics and a historical surge in sunburns and tanning bed use, with UV exposure remaining the leading cause of skin cancers. Experts caution that sunscreen can foster a false sense of security, potentially leading people to spend more time in the sun, thereby increasing their overall exposure risk, but stress that sunscreen itself is not carcinogenic. Protecting oneself from sunburn is highlighted as a fundamental step for long-term health.","**धूप के संपर्क और सुरक्षा: भ्रांतियों का निवारण**

हालिया अवलोकन ने धूप के संपर्क और सुरक्षा के बारे में कई सामान्य भ्रांतियों को स्पष्ट किया है। इसमें इस बात पर जोर दिया गया है कि इष्टतम स्वास्थ्य के लिए पर्याप्त, न कि अत्यधिक, विटामिन डी की आवश्यकता होती है। लंबे समय तक धूप के संपर्क में रहने से डीएनए को नुकसान होता है, जबकि इससे विटामिन डी3 लगातार बढ़ता नहीं है, और सनस्क्रीन के उपयोग को विटामिन डी की कमी से नहीं जोड़ा गया है।

सनस्क्रीन के उपयोग के संबंध में, यह लगाने के तुरंत बाद प्रभावी हो जाता है। अनुशंसित 15-20 मिनट की प्रतीक्षा अवधि उत्पाद को एक टिकाऊ, सुरक्षात्मक परत में सूखने देती है, न कि इसके 'सक्रियण' के लिए, हालांकि यह परत इससे भी तेजी से बन सकती है। उपयोगकर्ताओं को हमेशा निर्माता के निर्देशों का पालन करना चाहिए। प्राकृतिक छाया के लिए, घने और ऊँचे पेड़ों की सलाह दी जाती है।

यह लेख इस मिथक को भी दूर करता है कि गहरे रंग की त्वचा यूवी क्षति से प्रतिरक्षित होती है। जबकि मेलेनिन कुछ प्राकृतिक सुरक्षा प्रदान करता है, गहरे रंग की त्वचा वाले व्यक्ति अभी भी सनबर्न, त्वचा कैंसर और हाइपरपिग्मेंटेशन के प्रति संवेदनशील होते हैं, जो धूप से सुरक्षा की सार्वभौमिक आवश्यकता को रेखांकित करता है।

इसके अतिरिक्त, सनस्क्रीन बढ़ती त्वचा कैंसर दरों के लिए जिम्मेदार नहीं है। मेलेनोमा में वृद्धि, विशेष रूप से हल्के रंग की त्वचा वाली आबादी के बीच, मुख्य रूप से बढ़ती उम्र की आबादी और सनबर्न तथा टैनिंग बेड के उपयोग में ऐतिहासिक उछाल के कारण हुई है, जबकि यूवी एक्सपोजर त्वचा कैंसर का प्रमुख कारण बना हुआ है। विशेषज्ञ आगाह करते हैं कि सनस्क्रीन सुरक्षा की झूठी भावना पैदा कर सकता है, जिससे लोग संभावित रूप से धूप में अधिक समय बिता सकते हैं और इस प्रकार उनके समग्र संपर्क जोखिम में वृद्धि हो सकती है। लेकिन वे इस बात पर जोर देते हैं कि सनस्क्रीन स्वयं कैंसरकारी नहीं है। खुद को सनबर्न से बचाना दीर्घकालिक स्वास्थ्य के लिए एक मूलभूत कदम के रूप में उजागर किया गया है।",en,[],,"From when exactly to use sunscreen to whether beach umbrellas really work, this is what scientific research tells us about staying safe in the Sun.",[''],www.bbc.com/innovation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also helped influence the airliners we fly on today. It was two years before Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbour dragged the United States into the war. But the US Army Air Corps was looking for a new bomber aircraft. What they were after was a ""superbomber"", capable of flying up to 2,000 miles (3,200km) at a time and at altitudes never achieved before. The aircraft they got would go on to drop the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and ultimately bring an end to World War Two. It would also pave the way for a civil aviation boom that led to the everyday air travel we have today. This is the story of how an aircraft that cost more than the entire Manhattan project – the B-29 Superfortress – changed the world. It was January 1940 when the US Army Air Corps (USAAC) approached five American aircraft companies with the request to build a bomber bigger than anything the world had ever seen. Although the US was yet to enter the Second World War, in Europe it was already raging: Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union had only months earlier invaded Poland and divided it between them.

It says more the majority of so-called ""insider"" cyber attacks and data breaches in education settings - meaning they have been carried out by someone with access to internal systems - originate with students. It has told teachers that they are failing to understand and recognise what it calls the ""insider threat"" pupils pose. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has issued a warning about what it calls the ""worrying trend"" of students hacking their own school and college IT systems for fun or as part of dares. It comes amid a spate of high profile cyber-attacks, affecting firms including M&S and Jaguar Land Rover, in which teenage hackers have been implicated. Since 2022, the ICO has investigated 215 hacks and breaches originating from inside education settings and says 57% were carried out by children. Other breaches are thought to come from staff, third party IT suppliers and other organisations with access. According to the new data, almost a third of the breaches involved students illegally logging into staff computer systems by guessing passwords or stealing details from teachers. In one incident, a seven-year-old was involved in a data breach and subsequently referred to the National Crime Agency's Cyber Choices programme to help them understand the seriousness of their actions. The ICO did not give details on the nature of that breach. In another incident three Year 11 students aged 15 or 16 unlawfully accessed school databases containing the personal information of more than 1,400 students. The pupils used hacking tools downloaded from the internet to break passwords and security protocols. When questioned, they said they were interested in cyber security and wanted to test their skills and knowledge. Another example the ICO gave is of a student illegally logging into their college's databases with a teachers' details to change or delete personal information belonging to more than 9,000 staff, students and applicants. The system stored personal information such as name and home address, school records, health data, safeguarding and pastoral logs and emergency contacts.

All phone users will be used to the small plastic cards they need to delicately insert into their devices to make them operate. But for buyers of the iPhone Air, that will be a thing of the past. It will only operate with an eSim - which allows users to switch networks or plans without resorting to a fiddly fork to open a tiny Sim card tray. Analyst Kester Mann, from CCS Insight, told BBC News that Apple's announcement ""marks the beginning of the end of the physical Sim card"". But how long will it be before we have all discarded our little chip-carrying pieces of plastic - and what difference will it make to how we use our phones? 'Expect the tray to disappear' Getty Images The physical Sim card have been synonymous with smartphones for years Sim stands for Subscriber Identity Module. The chip is a key part of your phone - allowing you to connect to your mobile network provider, handle calls and texts, and use your data. In recent years, the eSim has emerged as an alternative and in newer phones users have the option to use both a traditional Sim or the eSim. On Tuesday, in its product announcement for the new iPhone Air - the newest, and thinnest, addition to the Apple family - the tech giant said it would feature an eSim-only design. It is the first time that an eSim-only iPhone will be available around the world. Customers in the US have had eSim-only iPhones since 2022. But even Apple isn't abandoning the physical Sim card altogether. While it's true that the other new iPhones it announced this week - the 17, 17 Pro, 17 Pro Max - will be eSim only in a number of markets, in the majority of countries they will retain physical Sim card slots. Other major manufacturers, such as Samsung and Google, while embracing eSims as an option are also still maintaining physical Sim in most places. However, experts say there is no doubt about the direction of travel. According to CCS Insight's latest forecast, 1.3 billion smartphones with eSims were in use by the end of 2024. That figure is expected to reach 3.1 billion by 2030. ""In time, expect the Sim tray to disappear altogether,"" said Paolo Pescatore, a technology analyst at PP Foresight.

While eSim-only iPhones have been available in the US since 2022, and other new iPhone models along with devices from manufacturers like Samsung and Google still largely maintain physical SIM slots in many markets, experts see an undeniable trend towards eSim adoption.

It’s probably a lot older than you think. Since the dawn of human history, our species has been besieged by terrible viruses and deadly plagues. Smallpox, a viral disease defined by a rash of painful pustules across the body, has been one of the most lethal of all, claiming an estimated 300 million lives over the 20th century alone. The disease killed about one-third of those it infected. Of those who survived, one-third were left blind. Almost all were scarred for life. Neither riches nor geography were shields against the disease. Among its victims were Emperor Joseph I of Austria, King Louis I of Spain, Queen Mary II of England, King Louis XV of France and Tsar Peter II of Russia. By the 1800s, smallpox was killing more than 400,000 people a year around the world. Comment & Analysis David Robert Grimes is an adjunct assistant professor in public health at Trinity College Dublin and author of The Irrational Ape: Why we fall for disinformation, conspiracy theory, and propaganda. His work focuses on health disinformation and conspiracy theory. And so, when UK doctor Edward Jenner developed the first version of the smallpox vaccine in 1796, he was hopeful that he might change history. He had observed that milkmaids were curiously immune to smallpox, likely because of their prior infection by cowpox – a related, but much less dangerous, virus. To test the idea that he could confer smallpox immunity this way, he took material from a milkmaid's cowpox sore and injected it into the arm of an eight-year-old child – an experiment that would be unacceptable by the standards of modern medical ethics. The boy proved immune to smallpox infection. Jenner named the procedure after the Latin for cow, vacca – and the first vaccine was born.","Vaccine skepticism is not a new phenomenon but has deep historical roots dating back to the 1800s, coinciding with humanity's long struggle against devastating diseases. Smallpox, one of history's most lethal viruses, claimed an estimated 300 million lives in the 20th century alone. It typically killed one-third of those infected, blinded another third of survivors, and left almost all scarred for life. By the 1800s, smallpox caused over 400,000 deaths annually worldwide, affecting all social strata, including royalty.

In 1796, UK doctor Edward Jenner developed the first smallpox vaccine. He observed that milkmaids, infected with the milder cowpox virus, were immune to smallpox. To test this, Jenner inoculated an eight-year-old child with material from a cowpox sore, successfully conferring immunity to smallpox. He named the procedure ""vaccine,"" derived from ""vacca,"" the Latin word for cow.","वैक्सीन संशयवाद (टीके को लेकर संदेह) कोई नई घटना नहीं है, बल्कि इसकी गहरी ऐतिहासिक जड़ें 1800 के दशक तक जाती हैं, जब मानवता विनाशकारी बीमारियों से जूझ रही थी। चेचक, इतिहास के सबसे घातक वायरसों में से एक, ने अकेले 20वीं सदी में अनुमानित 30 करोड़ लोगों की जान ले ली। यह आमतौर पर संक्रमितों में से एक-तिहाई को मार देता था, बचे हुए लोगों में से एक-तिहाई को अंधा कर देता था, और लगभग सभी को जीवन भर के लिए निशान छोड़ देता था। 1800 के दशक तक, चेचक दुनिया भर में सालाना 4 लाख से अधिक मौतों का कारण बनता था, जो राजघरानों सहित सभी सामाजिक वर्गों को प्रभावित करता था।

1796 में, ब्रिटेन के डॉक्टर एडवर्ड जेनर ने चेचक का पहला टीका विकसित किया। उन्होंने देखा कि दूध दुहने वाली महिलाएं, जो हल्के काउपॉक्स वायरस से संक्रमित होती थीं, वे चेचक के प्रति प्रतिरक्षित थीं। इसका परीक्षण करने के लिए, जेनर ने काउपॉक्स के घाव से प्राप्त सामग्री से एक आठ साल के बच्चे को टीका लगाया, जिससे उसे सफलतापूर्वक चेचक के प्रति प्रतिरोधक क्षमता मिल गई। उन्होंने इस प्रक्रिया को 'वैक्सीन' नाम दिया, जो 'वाक्का' (vacca), यानी गाय के लिए लैटिन शब्द से लिया गया है।",en,[],,"Vaccine scepticism may seem like a new, growing movement.

Divorce is greying. The US has one of the highest divorce rates in the world, even though over the past four decades, it has fallen among younger couples. Instead, middle-aged and older adults have taken over. In fact, adults aged 65 and older are now the only age group in the US with a growing divorce rate. For the over-50s, the rate also rose for decades, but has now stabilised. Today, roughly 36% of people getting divorced are 50 and older, compared to only 8.7% in 1990. This is known as a ""grey divorce"". This tilt towards later-in-life divorce is happening for a mix of reasons, studies suggest. Lives are longer than they used to be, for a start, and older couples may be less willing to put up with unfulfilling marriages than before. Meanwhile, young people are getting married later and have become more selective when choosing a partner. As one researcher puts it, ""the United States is progressing toward a system in which marriage is rarer and more stable than it was in the past"".","Divorce in later life, termed ""grey divorce,"" is a growing phenomenon in the US, particularly among adults aged 65 and older, who now represent the only age group with a rising divorce rate, reaching a global all-time high. Roughly 36% of all US divorces today involve individuals 50 and older, a significant increase from 8.7% in 1990, with the average age of divorce being 50.

This trend stands in contrast to younger couples, whose divorce rates have declined as they marry later and more selectively. Scientists are exploring the deep impact this later-life marital dissolution has on adult children. Contributing factors to grey divorce include longer lifespans, leading older individuals to be less willing to remain in unfulfilling marriages.

यह प्रवृत्ति युवा जोड़ों के विपरीत है, जिनकी तलाक दरें कम हुई हैं क्योंकि वे देर से और अधिक सोच-समझकर शादी करते हैं। वैज्ञानिक इस देर जीवन वैवाहिक अलगाव के वयस्क बच्चों पर पड़ने वाले गहरे प्रभाव का अध्ययन कर रहे हैं। ग्रे तलाक के पीछे के कारकों में लंबी उम्र शामिल है, जिसके कारण वृद्ध व्यक्ति असंतोषजनक विवाहों में बने रहने के लिए कम इच्छुक होते हैं। कुल मिलाकर, अमेरिका एक ऐसी प्रणाली की ओर बढ़ रहा है जहाँ विवाह पिछले दशकों की तुलना में दुर्लभ लेकिन अधिक स्थिर है।",en,[],,Divorce in later life is becoming more common – and scientists are beginning to explore the surprisingly deep impact this can have on adult children and their relationships.,[''],www.bbc.com/innovation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First George A Romero and then Frank Darabont owned the rights to the book but failed to get it over the finish line, despite having previous with King in the form of Creepshow and The Dark Half, in Romero's case, and The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile and The Mist, in Darabont's. Lawrence succeeded where they failed, and did so without sanitising the harrowing story to make it more palatable for mainstream audiences. ""You need to feel the miles and the time [passing], and feel the degradation – emotionally, psychologically, physically,"" he insists. ""I wasn't going to dilute that and make the studio feel super-comfy with it."" King is not a pessimist – he believes in the power of common decency, and most of his books end with whatever the monster is being defeated – Simon Brown ""There's something relentlessly pessimistic about the nature of the story – lots of young people being killed,"" agrees freelance film programmer and writer Michael Blyth, who was a senior programmer at the British Film Institute when it mounted a month-long retrospective of King's films back in 2015. ""But at the same time, there's a lot of kindness in there. The boys don't turn on each other. They're quite supportive. There's something about friendship and brotherhood that's very present in the book."" Simon Brown concurs. An independent scholar and member of the horror studies research group at Northumbria University who has taught on King, he is the author of Screening Stephen King: Adaptation and the Horror Genre in Film and Television. ""The Long Walk is so bleak and miserable,"" he chuckles. ""The only other King book that approaches this level of bleakness is Pet Sematary, which is a dialogue on death. But King is not a pessimist. He believes in the power of common decency, and most of his books end with whatever the monster is being defeated. The Long Walk is evidently a template for what would become a Stephen King book: you take a bunch of characters, put them into a situation, and see what they do. You can see that in The Stand, Under the Dome, The Mist… His books aren't about the monsters, they're about the people who meet the monsters. Here, it's not about the walk, it's about the people on the walk. And they're all ordinary people."" The birth (and death) of Richard Bachman The Long Walk was the second of five novels that King released under the pseudonym of Richard Bachman between 1977 and 1984. The bestselling author invented a nom de plume to ""turn the heat down a little bit"", as his debut novel, Carrie, had been quickly followed onto shelves by bestsellers Salem's Lot, The Shining and The Stand. His publishers, Doubleday and Company, Inc, liked to trumpet that there were ""over 40 million King books in print"", but King found himself wondering if his success was down to talent, his celebrity or just plain luck. It was a question that he felt the Bachman experiment might answer. ""It is depressing to think it was all – or even mostly – an accident,"" he wrote in his introduction to The Bachman Books, a compendium published in 1985. ""So maybe you try to find out if you could do it again. Or in my case, if Bachman could do it again.""","Lawrence has successfully adapted Stephen King's novel ""The Long Walk,"" a feat where previous attempts by George A. Romero and Frank Darabont failed. Lawrence prioritized fidelity to the novel's grim and despairing tone, specifically its portrayal of ""emotional, psychological, [and] physical degradation,"" refusing to sanitize the harrowing story for mainstream audiences or studio comfort.

Often cited as King's most pessimistic and bleak work, both Lawrence and scholar Simon Brown acknowledge its harshness, comparing its bleakness only to ""Pet Sematary."" However, they emphasize that ""The Long Walk"" also highlights themes of kindness, friendship, and brotherhood among its ordinary characters. Brown and King himself assert that King is fundamentally not a pessimist, believing in common decency and hope, with most of his narratives concluding in the defeat of evil.

""The Long Walk"" is presented as a quintessential example of King's style, focusing on ordinary people placed in extreme situations to explore human reactions rather than the ""monsters"" or the ""walk"" itself. Notably, the novel was published under King's pseudonym, Richard Bachman, an experiment designed to determine if his success was attributable to talent rather than celebrity or luck, allowing him to ""turn the heat down a little bit"" after a rapid succession of bestsellers.","यहाँ अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

लॉरेंस ने स्टीफन किंग के उपन्यास ""द लॉन्ग वॉक"" का सफलतापूर्वक रूपांतरण किया है, यह एक ऐसी उपलब्धि है जहाँ जॉर्ज ए. रोमेरो और फ्रैंक डाराबोंट के पिछले प्रयास विफल रहे थे। लॉरेंस ने उपन्यास के कठोर और निराशाजनक स्वर के प्रति निष्ठा को प्राथमिकता दी, विशेष रूप से ""भावनात्मक, मनोवैज्ञानिक और शारीरिक पतन"" के उसके चित्रण को, उन्होंने मुख्यधारा के दर्शकों या स्टूडियो की सुविधा के लिए इस भयावह कहानी को हल्का करने से इनकार कर दिया।

किंग की सबसे निराशावादी और उदास कृति के रूप में अक्सर उद्धृत, लॉरेंस और विद्वान साइमन ब्राउन दोनों इसकी कठोरता को स्वीकार करते हैं, इसकी उदासी की तुलना केवल ""पेट सेमेटरी"" से करते हैं। हालांकि, वे इस बात पर जोर देते हैं कि ""द लॉन्ग वॉक"" अपने साधारण पात्रों के बीच दयालुता, दोस्ती और भाईचारे जैसे विषयों को भी उजागर करता है। ब्राउन और किंग स्वयं इस बात पर जोर देते हैं कि किंग मूल रूप से निराशावादी नहीं हैं, वे सामान्य शालीनता और आशा में विश्वास करते हैं, और उनकी अधिकांश कथाएँ बुराई की हार के साथ समाप्त होती हैं।

""द लॉन्ग वॉक"" को किंग की शैली का एक सर्वोत्कृष्ट उदाहरण प्रस्तुत किया गया है, जो ""राक्षसों"" या ""वॉक"" के बजाय मानवीय प्रतिक्रियाओं का पता लगाने के लिए अत्यधिक परिस्थितियों में रखे गए साधारण लोगों पर केंद्रित है। गौरतलब है कि यह उपन्यास किंग के छद्म नाम रिचर्ड बाकमैन के तहत प्रकाशित हुआ था। यह एक ऐसा प्रयोग था जिसे यह निर्धारित करने के लिए डिज़ाइन किया गया था कि क्या उनकी सफलता प्रतिभा के कारण थी, न कि सेलिब्रिटी या भाग्य के कारण, जिससे उन्हें लगातार बेस्टसेलर की एक श्रृंखला के बाद ""थोड़ा दबाव कम करने"" की अनुमति मिली।",en,[],,The Long Walk imagines young men competing in a deadly marathon for entertainment.

A Dawning is an inspired collaboration, a celebration of kindred spirits and a deeply poignant commemoration; Arnalds began working with poetic Irish singer-songwriter Talos (aka Eoin French) when the two met at an independent music festival. However, French fell ill from cancer and died aged just 36, before this album could be completed. These songs undeniably become a meditation on mortality and grief, but they are also essentially shaped by love. Arnalds' instrumentation is sensitive and unaffectedly heartfelt, including ambient electronica and delicate strings; French sounds intensely present, and his gorgeously brooding vocals stay with you, through to the bittersweet folk harmonies of the closing number We Didn't Know We Were Ready. (AH) Pinkpantheress – Fancy That Few artists leave you wanting more quite as masterfully as 24-year-old British singer-songwriter-producer Victoria Beverley Walker, aka PinkPantheress, whose whirlwind, sample-heavy songs often just reach over two minutes. Far from slight, though, this second mixtape of hers – running to just 20 minutes in total – is a piece of sonic alchemy, whose constant, exhilarating rush of melodic momentum belies its rich patchwork of influences and references. There's garage and drum-and-bass beats, hooks borrowed from old-school house tracks by the likes of Groove Armada and Basement Jaxx, and yearning, high-pitched vocal lines. Beguiling, too, are the lyrics, with Pink serving up a pithy, conversational exploration of romantic pains, from frustrated crushes (Tonight) to toxic exes (Girl Like Me). If she's this inimitable and self-assured at this stage in her career, you wonder, in the best way, where she can go from here. (HM) Cody Critcheloe Perfume Genius – Glory Seattle-raised, LA-based Mike Hadreas was finding the strength in vulnerability long before wellness influencers made this idea commonplace. With Glory, his seventh album as Perfume Genius, the art-pop moniker with which he introduced himself on MySpace back in 2008, he sounds more powerful than ever before. Working with his multi-instrumentalist partner Alan Wyffels and longtime producer Blake Mills, Hadreas has crafted a profoundly moving reflection on ageing, relationships and his anxiety in facing the outside world. ""What do I get out of being established? I still run and hide when a man's at the door,"" he sings on the country-flecked It's a Mirror. He's equally affecting on the tender piano ballad Me & Angel, perhaps this year's most intimate and realistic love song. The more you listen to this remarkable alt-rock record, the more its shards of truth and beauty come to the fore. (NL) Rose Gray – Louder, Please Following a mixtape and two EPs, Gray's full-length debut is a great dance album that's also a great pop album. The rave-loving singer once worked the door at London superclub Fabric, so there's cool conviction to the way she pings between Balearic anthems (Free, Tectonic), tumbling drum and bass (First) and pounding piano house (Wet & Wild). Along the way, she finds a sweet spot between galvanising mantras – ""Kiss the sky until the morning"" – and winning cultural specificity. On standout track Hackney Wick, she guides us through a messy night out in East London with references to local landmarks. There's also a yearning for emotional connection threaded into the album's heady hedonism. ""Everything changes, but I won't when the party stops being fun,"" she sings on Everything Changes (But I Won't). It all adds up to a life-affirming listen that's best enjoyed as Gray recommends in the title: louder, please. (NL) Turnstile – Never Enough Baltimore hardcore rockers Turnstile occupy an unconventional space; they're connected to their underground punk roots while increasingly extending their range, both in terms of creative expressions and commercial reach. Their fourth album Never Enough is a natural progression from 2021's excellent Glow On, but it also pushes their vision further, from the surging synths and mighty guitars of the opening title track. Rousing vocalist Brendan Yates leads the powerfully catchy melodies; Turnstile's sound is thrillingly unconstrained, embracing thrashy riffs and blissed-out reveries (sometimes on the same track), and multi-genre collaborators including Dev Hynes, Hayley Williams and UK jazz don Shabaka Hutchings (playing flute on Sunshower). It's a gloriously unpredictable, exhilarating headrush of a record. (AH) Iris Luz Wet Leg – Moisturizer There's something beautifully immediate about the rock-craft of this British, female-led indie band, who came to the fore back in 2022 with the single Chaise Longue, which captured the imagination with its nagging, post-punk guitars and surreal lyrics, delivered deadpan. This follow-up to their self-titled debut album doesn't see them undergoing any radical shifts but instead confidently refines their formula, being both a tighter and more pumped-up listen. The big change, lyrically, is that their previous, amusing disaffection with romance, and twentysomething life in general, has been supplanted by frontwoman Rhian Teasdale's new relationship, which results in some love songs, albeit ones rushing with anxiety: opener CPR has her wondering ""is it love or suicide?"". And they can still do a brilliant takedown: Moisturizer's highlight is Mangetout, in which they witheringly call an unspecified man a ""bottom feeder"" and tell him to ""get lost forever"". Altogether, it makes for a record of ferocious wit and unassailable riffs.

But despite Core's phone records showing the police station was called at around 17:30, Minnie Herring, the jailer's wife, denied that anyone inquired about the three men. At around 22:30, the three civil rights workers were finally allowed to pay the fine, and were released from custody. Price told them to leave the county. They were not heard from again. Mystery sparks huge response Bond believed that the disappearance was designed to spread fear among the people working on Freedom Summer. And while it did cause a couple of volunteers to have second thoughts, he said that for many of the activists it served to underscore the importance of what they were trying to achieve: getting black people registered to vote. ""They are determined they are going to continue doing what they are doing… and the disappearance of those three just shows them exactly what they are up against,"" Bond told the BBC in July 1964. ""That there are people in this country who will do anything to stop democracy from becoming a reality."" Unlike previous victims of racial violence, the missing men prompted a huge response from the US Justice Department. Attorney General Robert Kennedy classified the case as a kidnapping so it came under federal jurisdiction, and he ordered some 150 FBI agents from the New Orleans office to comb the area to find them. They were joined in the search by troops from a nearby naval airbase, and on 23 July the men's burnt-out car was discovered near a swamp. But there was no sign of the three civil rights workers. The investigation was codenamed Miburn – short for Mississippi Burning. As it gathered momentum, it began to attract widespread interest from the press. ""It was huge, there were news reporters camped out in front of our apartment building,"" David Goodman, the younger brother of Andrew Goodman, told BBC Witness History in 2014. ""The police were there 24 hours a day just to control the crowds. It was very hard to focus on anything."" He believed that the difference between the law enforcement response to the Mississippi Burning case and the response to previous attacks on civil rights workers was that two of the missing men were white. ""It shocked white middle America and the sense was, how could this happen to white people? This is a part of the story that's not told that often, when a majority sees their own being hurt. They sit up and say, 'Jesus this could happen to my kids or me,'"" he said. Schwerner's wife Rita, who also worked for Core, told reporters at the time: ""It is only because my husband and Andrew Goodman were white that the national alarm has been sounded.""","In the febrile atmosphere of 1964, three CORE civil rights workers disappeared after being released from custody. Despite standard procedure, a phone call to a local police station about their non-return was denied by the jailer's wife. The men were finally released around 22:30 after paying a fine, were instructed to leave the county, and were last seen heading to a nearby hotel for a drink before vanishing.

Activist Bond believed their disappearance was designed to spread fear during Freedom Summer. While it caused some volunteers to have second thoughts, it primarily galvanized many activists, underscoring the importance of voter registration and the lengths to which opponents would go to prevent ""democracy from becoming a reality.""

Uniquely, this incident prompted a massive response from the US Justice Department. Attorney General Robert Kennedy classified it as a kidnapping, bringing it under federal jurisdiction. He deployed approximately 150 FBI agents and naval troops to search for the men. On July 23, their burnt-out car was discovered near a swamp, but there was no sign of the civil rights workers.

The ensuing investigation, codenamed ""Miburn"" (Mississippi Burning), garnered widespread press interest, attracting intense media scrutiny and constant police presence. David Goodman, brother of one of the missing, and Schwerner's wife Rita, attributed the unprecedented national alarm and federal intervention to the fact that two of the missing men were white.

कार्यकर्ता बॉन्ड का मानना था कि उनका लापता होना फ्रीडम समर के दौरान भय फैलाने के उद्देश्य से था। हालांकि इसने कुछ स्वयंसेवकों को पुनर्विचार करने पर मजबूर किया, इसने मुख्य रूप से कई कार्यकर्ताओं को प्रेरित और एकजुट किया, जिससे मतदाता पंजीकरण के महत्व और विरोधियों द्वारा 'लोकतंत्र को वास्तविकता बनने से रोकने' के लिए किस हद तक जाया जा सकता था, यह रेखांकित हुआ।

अभूतपूर्व रूप से, इस घटना ने अमेरिकी न्याय विभाग से एक व्यापक प्रतिक्रिया को जन्म दिया। अटॉर्नी जनरल रॉबर्ट कैनेडी ने इसे अपहरण के रूप में वर्गीकृत किया, जिससे यह संघीय अधिकार क्षेत्र में आ गया। उन्होंने उन आदमियों की तलाश के लिए लगभग 150 एफबीआई एजेंटों और नौसेना के सैनिकों को तैनात किया। 23 जुलाई को, उनकी जली हुई कार एक दलदल के पास पाई गई, लेकिन नागरिक अधिकार कार्यकर्ताओं का कोई निशान नहीं था।

इसके बाद की जांच, जिसका कोडनेम ""मिबर्न"" (मिसिसिपी बर्निंग) था, ने व्यापक प्रेस का ध्यान आकर्षित किया, जिससे गहन मीडिया छानबीन और लगातार पुलिस उपस्थिति बनी रही। गायब हुए लोगों में से एक के भाई डेविड गुडमैन और श्वर्नर की पत्नी रीटा ने इस अभूतपूर्व राष्ट्रीय चिंता और संघीय हस्तक्षेप का कारण यह बताया कि लापता हुए दो लोग श्वेत थे। उन्होंने तर्क दिया कि इसने ""श्वेत मध्य अमेरिका को चौंका दिया"", जिससे उन्हें यह एहसास हुआ कि ऐसी हिंसा ""मेरे बच्चों या मेरे साथ भी हो सकती है"", एक ऐसी प्रतिक्रिया जो नस्लीय हिंसा के अश्वेत पीड़ितों के लिए अक्सर अनुपस्थित रहती थी।",en,[],,"In August 1964, three civil rights activists were found dead in the Deep South.

It sounds like a snapshot of the city's cosmopolitan history - colonial buildings like the General Post Office and the former British viceroy's mansion, Hindu and Jain temples, Greek Orthodox and Portuguese churches, an Anglican cathedral, the homes of freedom fighters who fought the British Raj and Indian merchants who prospered under it. But unlike most heritage tours, this one happens after sundown. And its main focus is not just the history or architecture but the lights illuminating the buildings. Kolkata Illumination Project is the latest addition to the city's many heritage tours and walks. Mr Sen, who runs a tour company, chanced upon a newspaper article about city enthusiasts lighting up some of the city's grand but often neglected heritage buildings. He obtained a list of buildings and went to check them out. ""I was stunned,"" he says. ""I have seen Paris by night. I didn't realise Kolkata could be like that also. I wanted other people to see it as well."" Himanjali Sankar, born and raised in Kolkata, now living in Delhi, joined the tour. She says the buildings themselves are familiar to her but the illumination changes them. ""It is like they are coming alive, reclaiming their grandeur."" The project is the brainchild of a citizens' group called Kolkata Restorers. ""But it's not a real organisation. There is no committee, no president. It's just a label. A WhatsApp group,"" says Mudar Patherya, the force behind the endeavour. Mudar Patherya Built in the early 20th century by an Armenian builder, Queens Mansion is a heritage landmark Mudar Patherya Raj Bhavan, formerly the Governor's House, is one of Kolkata's grandest colonial-era buildings He says he didn't start out with plans to light up the city. He came upon an old market crowned with a grand dome and a broken clock that had numerals in Bengali, the language most commonly spoken in the city. An avowed Kolkata evangelist, he wanted to paint the dome and raised the money for it from friends and associates. ""But then I realised while it looked good during the day, in the evening it could not be seen at all,"" he says. ""So I again passed the hat around and raised money to illuminate it."" He ended up with some funds left over. So he also lit up a temple tucked away in a storied north Kolkata neighbourhood. The temple's intricately carved stone facade came alive in the soft yellow glow of the LED lights in a way it could not in harsh sunlight. Mr Patherya was hooked. Within weeks he had lined up the imposing British neoclassical colonial building housing the Geological Survey of India. Soon he got permission to light up one of the city's most famous addresses - Raj Bhavan, the governor's mansion, once the residence of the British viceroy. ""In about 21 months we are at about 92 buildings,"" he says. ""The model is simple. It's your property, my lights. You only pay for the electricity and I work out that cost in advance."" Getting the light intensity right required trial and error, says lighting designer Suyash Narsaria. Mudar Patherya Burhani Masjid, with its striking domes and minarets, is one of the city's prominent mosques for Bohra Muslims Mudar Patherya The brightly lit up Kalachand temple in north Kolkata ""We reduced the wattage to make it more efficient, changed the positions, put lighting in layers to highlight columns, railings and murals."" But as the project expanded, Mr Patherya realised there was one problem he had not foreseen, beyond squirrels chewing through the wires. The buildings were often in a state of disrepair and the illumination highlighted that. Before they could illuminate, they needed to be repaired and restored. For example, the 150-year-old Hogg Market, a huge Gothic market where one can find everything from parrots to hyperlocal Bandel cheese and Christmas cakes from a Jewish bakery. But the clock on its clock tower had stopped working. They found the roof had worn away and the floorboards had rotted in the rains. The tower had to be repaired first. But it's not easy to fix clocks that are over a century old. Luckily, Mr Patherya found the man who could help him. Swapan Dutta, a fourth-generation clock repairer, traces his lineage back to a great-grandfather who worked as a clock technician for the British-era firm Cooke and Kelvey. Mr Dutta, nicknamed 'Ghari-babu' or Clock-man, is excited to work on the Hogg Market clock, which he calls the star of Kolkata's tower clocks. It's a clock that chimes every fifteen minutes, a different tune for every quarter hour, a sound the city has not heard in years. Mudar Patherya The Dalhousie area, the seat of government and the site of many of the illuminated buildings Mudar Patherya The Angel of Victory atop Kolkata's Victoria Memorial - a 16-ft bronze figure designed to rotate with the wind. ""These clocks had stopped working for years...We have to examine them, make calculations and reconstruct all the missing parts,"" says Mr Dutta sitting in his tiny workshop. But he is confident Kolkata's tower clocks will chime again. Mr Dutta has already repaired over half a dozen clocks for Mr Patherya, in churches, a synagogue and old markets. What Kolkata Restorers are really trying to restore are not buildings but a sense of pride in the city. Once the capital of British India, the city's fortunes have waned since independence. Its eclectic mix of neoclassical, Gothic and Art Deco architecture is fast disappearing, as old houses give way to apartments and malls - the land valued more than the heritage, with owners unable to maintain what remains. ""Mostly we talk about how Kolkata is not keeping up with the times,"" says Himanjali Sankar. ""It is wonderful to see people who are excited and passionate about the city and its buildings."" But in a city anxious to woo business, heritage is often dismissed as an expensive luxury and a low priority. Mudar Patherya The clock tower of the Maghen David Synagogue - one of the city's most prominent Jewish landmarks Bishan Samaddar Returned Letter Office - a striking red-brick colonial building that once handled undeliverable mail in Kolkata","Kolkata is undergoing a nocturnal transformation, now sparkling ""like Paris at night"" thanks to the ""Kolkata Illumination Project."" This initiative, driven by an informal citizens' group called ""Kolkata Restorers"" and spearheaded by Mudar Patherya, aims to light up the city's grand, often neglected, colonial-era buildings, temples, and markets.

Patherya began by illuminating a market dome, quickly realizing the power of nighttime lighting. His project rapidly expanded, reaching 92 buildings in just 21 months, operating on a simple model: ""your property, my lights,"" with property owners covering electricity costs. The project has amazed locals like tour operator Mr. Sen and resident Himanjali Sankar, who describe the illuminated structures as ""coming alive"" and ""reclaiming their grandeur.""

However, the illumination revealed a critical unforeseen challenge: many heritage buildings were in disrepair. This led the project to evolve beyond lighting, prompting restoration efforts. For instance, the iconic 150-year-old Hogg Market required extensive repairs, including its clock tower, which had stopped working. Swapan Dutta, a fourth-generation clock repairer, is now diligently restoring these century-old tower clocks, promising to bring back sounds the city hasn't heard in years.

Ultimately, ""Kolkata Restorers"" aims to do more than just light up buildings; they seek to restore a sense of pride in the city's rich heritage, which, since its days as the capital of British India, has often been dismissed as an ""expensive luxury"" amidst aspirations for modern development.","**कोलकाता इल्युमिनेशन प्रोजेक्ट: शहर का रात में कायापलट और विरासत का पुनरुद्धार**

कोलकाता में एक रात का कायापलट हो रहा है, जो अब 'कोलकाता इल्युमिनेशन प्रोजेक्ट' की बदौलत 'रात में पेरिस की तरह' जगमगा रहा है। यह पहल एक अनौपचारिक नागरिक समूह 'कोलकाता रेस्टोरर्स' द्वारा संचालित है और इसका नेतृत्व मुदार पाथेरिया कर रहे हैं। इसका उद्देश्य शहर की भव्य, अक्सर उपेक्षित, औपनिवेशिक काल की इमारतों, मंदिरों और बाज़ारों को रोशन करना है।

पाथेरिया ने एक बाज़ार के गुंबद को रोशन करके इसकी शुरुआत की और जल्द ही रात की रोशनी की शक्ति को महसूस किया। उनका यह प्रोजेक्ट तेज़ी से फैला और सिर्फ़ 21 महीनों में 92 इमारतों तक पहुँच गया। यह एक सरल मॉडल पर काम करता है: 'आपकी संपत्ति, मेरी रोशनी', जिसमें संपत्ति मालिक बिजली का खर्च उठाते हैं। इस प्रोजेक्ट ने टूर ऑपरेटर श्री सेन और निवासी हिमांजलि शंकर जैसे स्थानीय लोगों को चकित कर दिया है, जो रोशन की गई इमारतों को 'जीवित हो उठना' और 'अपनी भव्यता पुनः प्राप्त करना' बताते हैं।

हालांकि, रोशनी ने एक गंभीर अप्रत्याशित चुनौती को उजागर किया: कई विरासत इमारतें जर्जर हालत में थीं। इससे यह प्रोजेक्ट रोशनी से आगे बढ़कर, पुनर्स्थापन के प्रयासों को प्रेरित करने लगा। उदाहरण के लिए, प्रतिष्ठित 150 साल पुराने हॉग मार्केट को व्यापक मरम्मत की आवश्यकता थी, जिसमें उसका घड़ी का टावर भी शामिल था, जिसने काम करना बंद कर दिया था। स्वपन दत्ता, जो चौथी पीढ़ी के घड़ी मरम्मत करने वाले हैं, अब इन सदियों पुरानी टावर घड़ियों को लगन से बहाल कर रहे हैं। वे उन आवाज़ों को वापस लाने का वादा कर रहे हैं जो शहर ने सालों से नहीं सुनी हैं।

अंततः, 'कोलकाता रेस्टोरर्स' सिर्फ़ इमारतों को रोशन करने से कहीं ज़्यादा करना चाहते हैं; उनका लक्ष्य शहर की समृद्ध विरासत में गौरव की भावना को पुनः स्थापित करना है, जिसे ब्रिटिश भारत की राजधानी होने के बाद से, आधुनिक विकास की आकांक्षाओं के बीच अक्सर एक 'महंगी विलासिता' के रूप में खारिज कर दिया गया है।",en,[],,"In 21 months, citizens have lit up 92 Kolkata landmarks with a simple model: your property, their lights.",[''],www.bbc.com/culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sydney Sweeney trained for months, muscled up, and put on 30lb (13.6kg) to play Christy Martin, a real-life champion boxer with a dramatic personal story. She wears a dark wig and brown contact lenses. And yet it is impossible to forget that she is Sydney Sweeney in the cliché-ridden biopic Christy, as our hyperawareness of her off-screen image distracts us from what's going on in the film, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival this week. A contradiction at the heart of Christy is that Sweeney is the main reason anyone is paying attention to the project, but her own high-profile celebrity makes it difficult to believe her as the character. Can she ever escape the real-life chatter around her? The film pushes a lot of buttons, offering everything from an archetypal sports underdog to an actor's remarkable physical change The actress has been the centre of often unpleasant publicity, especially in recent months. There was a notable kerfuffle about her American Eagle ads, with the tag line ""Sydney Sweeney has great jeans"", which some took as a reference to Aryan genes. Then Donald Trump praised her for being a registered Republican. And The Hollywood Reporter wondered where her career would go ""after being in the centre of the storm"". That's not the kind of baggage any actor wants to be carrying on screen, but with Sweeney it's impossible to put aside right now. More like this: • Charli XCX shines in quirky film debut • The Gaza docudrama leaving audiences 'distraught' • A House of Dynamite is 'more terrifying than horror' It doesn't help that for almost all of its running time, David Michôd's film is just one more underdog sports story. It charts Christy Martin's rise to the top as a pioneer of women's boxing in the 1990s, prioritising the predictable sports story over her much more fascinating personal drama. Christy trains with and soon marries Jim Martin, a controlling bully 25 years her senior, with a laughable comb-over. He is played by Ben Foster, who successfully disappears into his role as a thoroughly despicable person. Martin is condescending, telling Christy, ""Maybe there is something to this lady boxing business."" He realises she is gay but forces her into the closet, saying, ""Nobody wants to see a butch girl fight.""","Sydney Sweeney's new film, ""Christy,"" premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival, showcasing her remarkable physical transformation into real-life champion boxer Christy Martin, a role for which she gained 30lb (13.6kg) and trained for months.

Despite Sweeney's dedication, the biopic is criticized for its cliché-ridden narrative and inability to overcome the star's high-profile, often controversial, real-life persona. Her celebrity, amplified by recent publicity including an ""Aryan genes"" ad kerfuffle and a Donald Trump endorsement, creates an inescapable ""baggage"" that makes it difficult for audiences to see her purely as the character.

David Michôd's film chronicles Martin's rise as a pioneer of women's boxing in the 1990s, but prioritizes a predictable sports underdog story over her more compelling personal drama. Central to this is her relationship with controlling husband and trainer, Jim Martin, 25 years her senior, into whose despicable role Ben Foster successfully disappears. Jim is depicted as condescending and manipulative, forcing Christy into the closet upon discovering her sexuality, declaring, ""Nobody wants to see a butch girl fight.""

Ultimately, Sweeney's significant physical effort and performance are deemed insufficient to fix the film's flaws or fully distract from the ongoing public chatter surrounding her.","सिडनी स्वीनी की नई फिल्म, ""क्रिस्टी"", का प्रीमियर टोरंटो इंटरनेशनल फिल्म फेस्टिवल में हुआ, जिसमें उन्होंने वास्तविक जीवन की चैंपियन मुक्केबाज़ क्रिस्टी मार्टिन के रूप में अपना उल्लेखनीय शारीरिक परिवर्तन प्रदर्शित किया। इस भूमिका के लिए उन्होंने 30 पाउंड (13.6 किलोग्राम) वज़न बढ़ाया और महीनों तक प्रशिक्षण लिया।

स्वीनी के समर्पण के बावजूद, इस बायोपिक की आलोचना इसकी घिसी-पिटी कहानी और अभिनेत्री की हाई-प्रोफाइल, अक्सर विवादास्पद, वास्तविक जीवन की छवि पर हावी न हो पाने के लिए की गई है। उनकी प्रसिद्धि, जिसे हाल ही में ""आर्यन जीन्स"" विज्ञापन विवाद और डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प के समर्थन सहित प्रचार से और बल मिला है, एक ऐसा अपरिहार्य ""बोझ"" पैदा करती है जिससे दर्शकों के लिए उन्हें पूरी तरह से किरदार के रूप में देख पाना मुश्किल हो जाता है।

डेविड मिशोड की यह फिल्म 1990 के दशक में महिला मुक्केबाज़ी की एक अग्रणी के रूप में मार्टिन के उत्थान का वर्णन करती है, लेकिन यह उनकी अधिक दिलचस्प व्यक्तिगत कहानी के बजाय एक अनुमानित स्पोर्ट्स अंडरडॉग कहानी को प्राथमिकता देती है। इसके केंद्र में उनके नियंत्रणकारी पति और ट्रेनर, जिम मार्टिन के साथ उनका रिश्ता है, जो उनसे 25 साल बड़े हैं, और जिनकी घृणित भूमिका में बेन फोस्टर पूरी तरह से समा गए हैं। जिम को अहंकारी और जोड़-तोड़ करने वाले के रूप में चित्रित किया गया है, जो क्रिस्टी की लैंगिकता का पता चलने पर उन्हें अपनी पहचान छिपाने के लिए मजबूर करता है, यह कहते हुए कि, ""कोई भी मर्दाना दिखने वाली लड़की को लड़ते हुए नहीं देखना चाहता।""

अंततः, स्वीनी का महत्वपूर्ण शारीरिक प्रयास और प्रदर्शन फिल्म की खामियों को ठीक करने या उनके इर्द-गिर्द चल रही सार्वजनिक चर्चा से पूरी तरह विचलित करने के लिए अपर्याप्त माने गए हैं।",en,[],,Sydney Sweeney's remarkable transformation into champion boxer Christy Martin can't fix the film's flaws nor distract from the star's real-life persona.,[''],www.bbc.com/culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now it's finally back – and from the playful storytelling to the layered performances, there's a lot to savour. In the second season of Severance, one character spends hours practising how to put paper clips on properly (apparently there's a right and a wrong way). Other characters find a room full of goats in their office building, and out of the office someone finds a working phone booth on the street, as if that's an everyday thing. Yet viewers of season one of the series – among the most bracing and imaginative of recent years – know that its bizarro world is also relatable to anyone who has ever been bored at their job. With a perfect balance of the real and surreal, the show follows four employees who sort numbers floating on their computer screens at Lumon Industries, and who chose to have a chip put in their brains that cuts their memories in half. The person working inside the office, called the innie, has no knowledge of who they are beyond its walls – and their outside counterpart, or outie, has no memory of the working day. Identity crisis doesn't begin to describe it. The show's creator, Dan Erickson, was inspired by wishing that his tedious office temp job while he was a struggling screenwriter could zoom by as if it never happened, and his idea of being able to turn off your brain resonates especially well in our age of information overload. That twist on the familiar office-show premise is a great hook. But the series' true alchemy, and the secret of its success and acclaim, is how well it builds our emotional attachment to the characters in Lumon's Macrodata Refinement Department, who now realise they have made a terrible mistake. The cast makes them so credible that it's easy to empathize with the grief-stricken widower Mark (Adam Scott), fussy and lovelorn Irving (John Turturro), rebellious Helly (Britt Lower), and Dylan (Zach Cherry), an office drone who seemed hapless until he wasn't. Some series shake things up radically between seasons, but this is a seamless continuation that works the same magic with even more mind-bending turns. The plot picks up five months after the cliffhanging events we last saw, when Dylan stayed behind at Lumon Industries and laboriously held a switch that allowed the other three to briefly access their work memories while outside. Mark discovered that his wife, Gemma, might actually be alive, and is someone he encountered without recognising at work. Irv is an artist who for some reason has documents about Lumon employees hidden in his apartment. Most startling of all, Helly is Helena Eagan, heir to the Lumon fortune, who has undergone ""severance"", as the process is called, as a public display of confidence in it.","Apple TV+'s acclaimed surreal workplace drama, ""Severance,"" which premiered in 2022, has returned for its highly anticipated second season, offering more playful storytelling and layered performances.

The series centers on employees at the mysterious Lumon Industries who volunteer for a surgical procedure called ""severance,"" bifurcating their memories: a work-only ""innie"" has no knowledge of their outside life, and an outside-only ""outie"" has no memory of their workday. This bizarro yet relatable premise, inspired by creator Dan Erickson's wish for tedious jobs to ""zoom by,"" explores profound identity crises and the universal experience of workplace boredom.

The show's critical success stems from its seamless blend of the real and surreal, and its remarkable ability to build deep emotional attachment to its credible characters, such as the grief-stricken widower Mark (Adam Scott) and the fussy, lovelorn Irving (John Turturro).

Season two picks up five months after the dramatic cliffhanger, seamlessly continuing with even more mind-bending turns. Viewers will see characters grappling with bizarre office occurrences like a room full of goats or intricate paper clip training, alongside major plot developments. Mark discovers his supposedly deceased wife, Gemma, may be alive and working at Lumon, while Irving is revealed to be an artist with hidden company documents. Lumon heir Helena Eagan's own public severance further highlights the procedure's impact.","यहाँ अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद दिया गया है:

Apple TV+ का बहुचर्चित अतियथार्थवादी कार्यस्थल ड्रामा, ""सेवरेंस"", जो 2022 में प्रीमियर हुआ था, अपने बहुप्रतीक्षित दूसरे सीज़न के लिए लौट आया है, जिसमें अधिक चंचल कहानी और गहन प्रदर्शन देखने को मिलेंगे।

यह सीरीज़ रहस्यमय ल्यूमन इंडस्ट्रीज़ के उन कर्मचारियों पर केंद्रित है जो ""सेवरेंस"" नामक एक शल्य चिकित्सा प्रक्रिया के लिए स्वेच्छा से आगे आते हैं। यह प्रक्रिया उनकी यादों को दो हिस्सों में बांट देती है: एक ""इन्नी"" (जो केवल काम के लिए है) को अपने बाहरी जीवन की कोई जानकारी नहीं होती, और एक ""आउट्टी"" (जो केवल बाहरी दुनिया के लिए है) को अपने कार्यदिवस की कोई याद नहीं रहती। निर्माता डैन एरिक्सन की नीरस नौकरियों के ""तेज़ी से गुज़र जाने"" की इच्छा से प्रेरित यह विचित्र फिर भी संबंधित लगने वाला आधार, गहन पहचान संकटों और कार्यस्थल पर ऊबने के सार्वभौमिक अनुभव की पड़ताल करता है।

इस शो की आलोचनात्मक सफलता का श्रेय यथार्थ और अतियथार्थ के इसके सहज मिश्रण को जाता है, साथ ही यह अपने विश्वसनीय पात्रों, जैसे शोकग्रस्त विधुर मार्क (एडम स्कॉट) और झक्की, प्रेम में पड़े इरविंग (जॉन टर्टुरो) के प्रति गहरी भावनात्मक लगाव पैदा करने की उल्लेखनीय क्षमता रखता है।

दूसरा सीज़न नाटकीय क्लाइमेक्स के पाँच महीने बाद शुरू होता है, और भी अधिक दिमाग घुमा देने वाले मोड़ के साथ सहजता से आगे बढ़ता है। दर्शक प्रमुख कथानक विकासों के साथ-साथ पात्रों को विचित्र कार्यालयी घटनाओं, जैसे बकरियों से भरा एक कमरा या जटिल पेपर क्लिप प्रशिक्षण से जूझते हुए देखेंगे। मार्क को पता चलता है कि उसकी कथित मृत पत्नी जेम्मा जीवित हो सकती है और ल्यूमन में काम कर रही है, जबकि इरविंग एक कलाकार के रूप में सामने आता है जिसके पास कंपनी के गुप्त दस्तावेज़ हैं। ल्यूमन की उत्तराधिकारी हेलेना ईगन का स्वयं का सार्वजनिक ""सेवरेंस"" इस प्रक्रिया के प्रभाव को और भी उजागर करता है।",en,[],,"When it premiered in 2022, Apple TV+'s surreal workplace show was a hit.

Playing hits from every era of their 25-year career, they filled the stadium with light, and even indulged themselves with a giddy version of Whitney Houston's I Wanna Dance With Somebody. ""This is the song I warm up to in the car park,"" joked singer Chris Martin. The show closed the latest leg of their Music Of The Spheres Tour, which has circled the world four times since 2022. It is now the highest-attended tour in history, with more than 13m tickets sold. On stage, Martin promised it would resume ""somewhere in southern Africa in about 18 months"". Friday's show was held almost a week late, after a strike by London transport workers forced the band to postpone. ""I know it caused a lot of inconvenience for a lot of you,"" Martin told the crowd. ""In return we're going to play a show fifteen times better than any show we've ever played before. That's the pledge."" They might not have achieved that goal - Coldplay have already set themselves a ridiculously high bar - but this was stadium stagecraft at its absolute finest. Getty Images Coldplay are the first band to power a concert at Wembley Stadium entirely by renewable energy with no generator use. The concert is a sensory overload, full of LED writstbands, raining confetti, laser lights, spinning inflatables, 3D glasses that turn everything into hearts and stars, and even a brief puppet show (the operators, Drew and Nicolette, happily got engaged during last Saturday's concert). Martin is the glue that holds it together. He bounds across the stage like a puppy - or is it a youth pastor? - covering the length of the catwalk several times within the first few songs. His plan isn't just to bridge the gap between the band and the audience, it's to dismantle it entirely. ""I see you,"" he says repeatedly, identifying uber-fans at the front and distant figures in the vertigo seats. ""I see you over here with a Brazilian flag. And I see you, too, in the top corner with lights on your bodies. You look like you're from the movie Tron."" It's a schtick, for sure, but it fosters an incredible sense of unity. Those LED wristbands play a huge part, too, making everyone in the audience part of a giant tapestry of light. And there's a communal euphoria in singing along to hits like Paradise, The Scientist, Yellow and Sky Full of Stars. After the first 30 minutes, I realised that I'd barely looked at the giant screens above the stage. The audience is the show. Coldplay The Wembley concerts alone were attended by more than 800,000 people That's a contrast to most stadium concerts, where the message is more like: ""Look upon me, puny mortals, and be astonished by my divine talents and somewhat improbable physique."" Coldplay don't bother with any of that. Martin's bandmates Guy Berryman, Will Champion and Jonny Buckland would rather that no-one noticed them at all. Instead, they'd rather make a fuss over their special guests. In London, that means Venezuela's Simón Bolívar Orchestra - a group of youth players who've supported the band at all of their Wembley dates. They come out twice, for Viva La Vida and feelslikeimfallinginlove, twirling their cellos and jumping up and down as they provide the stirring string accompaniment. Palestinian-Chilean singer Elyanna, meanwhile, hogs the spotlight during We Pray, hitting some quite extraordinary high notes. Who has played the most shows at Wembley Stadium? Getty Images Coldplay - 16 nights on the Music of the Spheres tour, 2022-25* Taylor Swift - Eight nights on the Eras tour, 2024 Take That - Eight nights on the Progress tour, 2011 Oasis - Seven nights on the Live '25 tour, 2025 Michael Jackson - Seven nights on the Bad tour, 1988 * Including six nights in 2022 and 10 nights in 2025 Getty Images Coldplay formed in London in the late 1990s, initially under the name Starfish Musically, Coldplay's set-list is stacked. There's a thrilling version of Clocks that shudders with discordant guitar riffs before resolving into a powerful chorus; and an extended acoustic version of Sparks has fans swooning. Something Just Like This, an abominable song on record, becomes a euphoric mini-rave on stage; while Fix You is simply majestic. With the tour about to go on hiatus (or maybe because he keeps self-administering throat spray) Martin is on whimsical form. He describes Coldplay as ""the third best soft rock band in London""; randomly sings the opening lines of Wonderwall; and, during Paradise, invokes the dancehall star Shaggy, for no discernible reason. ""That song was by Shaggy,"" he declares, inaccurately. Towards the end of the show, he stops everything to celebrate Buckland's 48th birthday, presenting the guitarist with a Lego Batmobile and promising, ""I'll give you £1m if you build it before Fix You"". Then, preparing to play the album track Jupiter for the first time, he announces: ""This could be terrible. But if it is terrible, don't worry, we're going to play Yellow in a minute. ""Will Champion could fart in the microphone, as long as we play Yellow."" Coldplay were the first group to use LED wristbands at their concerts, and the technology has evolved to allow incredibly sophisticated light shows Martin later admits that his sense of humour ""gets me into trouble every day"". But not as much trouble as married tech CEO Andy Byron, who was caught in a loving embrace with his HR executive on the giant screens of a Coldplay concert in the US earlier this year. The moment - during part of the show where Martin serenades audience members with an improvised song - went viral, and has reportedly led to at least one divorce. So when the jumbotron section of the show starts on Friday, Martin issues a tongue-in-cheek disclaimer. ""Whatever happens here, stays here. Guaranteed. So if you've just embezzled the company funds, come on camera now. It's fine."" Before long, a young couple flashes up on the screen. ""Holy crap, don't put me through this again,"" the singer grimaces, only agreeing to play a song after they've flashed their wedding rings at the camera. Coldplay The band are due to take a well-deserved break The spontaneity and humour is part of what makes every Coldplay show unique, even when most of the set is painstakingly planned out. On Friday, fans at the final London date showed their appreciation. During the final encore of All My Love, thousands of them unfolded paper red hearts and held them above their heads - the culmination of a secret online project organised by a German fan called Hannah. It was a bittersweet moment. Fans know the band have a long break planned. And even if they use their gap year to make new music, Martin has announced it will be their penultimate album. ""The Coldplay catalogue, as it were, finishes,"" after 12 records he told BBC Radio 2's Jo Whiley in 2021. ""After that I think we will only tour."" On tonight's evidence, it doesn't matter. They could play the same setlist for the next 100 years and fans would flock to every show. See you there. Coldplay setlist","Coldplay recently wrapped up a triumphant 10-show residency at Wembley Stadium, concluding the latest leg of their record-breaking ""Music Of The Spheres"" Tour. The tour has sold over 13 million tickets globally, becoming the highest-attended in history, and the band is now taking a hiatus before resuming in Southern Africa in approximately 18 months.

The Wembley concerts were hailed as a dazzling, multi-sensory experience, showcasing hits from their 25-year career, an impromptu Whitney Houston cover, and innovative stagecraft. Notably, they were the first band to power a Wembley show entirely by renewable energy. Frontman Chris Martin served as the energetic ""glue,"" actively engaging with the audience through personalized greetings and whimsical humor. His dynamic stage presence aimed to dismantle the traditional barrier between band and crowd, fostering a ""communal euphoria"" enhanced by interactive LED wristbands that turned the audience into a vibrant tapestry of light.

The shows also featured special guests, including Venezuela's Simón Bolívar Orchestra and Palestinian-Chilean singer Elyanna. Martin even playfully referenced a viral jumbotron incident from a previous show, issuing a humorous disclaimer about events staying within the venue.

The final London performance, postponed from an earlier date due to a transport strike, culminated in a bittersweet moment as fans collectively displayed red paper hearts during the final encore, a gesture organized by a German fan. Looking to the future, Martin revealed that their next album will be their penultimate, after which Coldplay plans to focus exclusively on touring.","यहां अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

He was not expected to live, let alone race again. After defying all expectations, he told the BBC in 1977 how he willed himself to stay alive. When Formula 1 racing driver Niki Lauda spoke to the BBC in 1977, his face bore testimony to the trauma he had endured during the German Grand Prix. Trapped inside the burning wreckage of his smashed Ferrari on the Nürburgring circuit, Lauda had been badly scarred and had lost part of his ear to the flames. But the Austrian driver confessed to having no recollection of the crash that almost cost him his life on 1 August 1976. ""When I had the accident, I must have got a big bang on my head, and I lost the memory for I don't know, the last three minutes. And the following 20 minutes after the accident,"" he told the BBC just a year later. Warning: This article contains injury details that some may find disturbing or upsetting. When Lauda took part in the race, he was the reigning F1 world champion, having won his first title the year before. The 1976 season was shaping up to be a dramatic one, as Lauda and his rival, British driver James Hunt, battled it out for the top spot. (Their friendship and rivalry would become the subject of the Ron Howard film Rush in 2013, starring Daniel Brühl as Lauda and Chris Hemsworth as Hunt.) Lauda had already secured five wins going into the German Grand Prix, and was on course to clinch the world champion title again. But the sport was shockingly dangerous. By 1976, 63 drivers had been killed in Grand Prix motor racing, and on average one to two drivers were dying every season.","F1 champion Niki Lauda suffered a horrific, near-fatal accident at the Nürburgring circuit in Germany in August 1976. Trapped in the burning wreckage of his Ferrari, he sustained severe injuries, including facial trauma and losing part of his ear. Doctors initially gave him mere hours to live, and he was not expected to race again.

However, Lauda, who later told the BBC he ""willed myself to stay alive,"" defied all expectations, making a remarkable recovery despite confessing to having no recollection of the crash itself, only remembering a ""big bang on my head"" and being in a ""state of shock"" for the immediate aftermath.

At the time of the incident, Lauda was the reigning F1 world champion, having secured five wins and leading the 1976 season in a fierce rivalry with British driver James Hunt. The accident tragically underscored the shocking dangers of Grand Prix racing, a sport that had claimed 63 drivers' lives by 1976. Lauda's incredible comeback and his legendary rivalry with Hunt were later dramatized in the 2013 Ron Howard film, ""Rush.""","अगस्त 1976 में, F1 चैंपियन निकी लाउडा जर्मनी के नर्बर्गिंग सर्किट में एक भयानक, लगभग जानलेवा दुर्घटना का शिकार हो गए। अपनी जलती हुई फेरारी के मलबे में फंसे होने के कारण, उन्हें चेहरे पर गंभीर चोट और कान का कुछ हिस्सा खोने सहित गंभीर चोटें आईं। डॉक्टरों ने शुरू में उन्हें कुछ ही घंटों का मेहमान बताया था, और उनके फिर से रेसिंग करने की कोई उम्मीद नहीं थी।

हालांकि, लाउडा, जिन्होंने बाद में बीबीसी को बताया कि उन्होंने ""खुद को जीवित रहने के लिए मजबूर किया"", सभी उम्मीदों को धता बताते हुए एक उल्लेखनीय वापसी की। उन्होंने कबूल किया कि उन्हें दुर्घटना खुद याद नहीं थी, बस ""मेरे सिर पर एक जोरदार धमाका"" और तुरंत बाद की स्थिति में ""सदमे की स्थिति"" में होना याद था।

इस घटना के समय, लाउडा मौजूदा F1 विश्व चैंपियन थे, जिन्होंने पांच जीत हासिल की थीं और ब्रिटिश ड्राइवर जेम्स हंट के साथ कड़ी प्रतिद्वंद्विता में 1976 के सीज़न में आगे चल रहे थे। इस दुर्घटना ने ग्रैंड प्रिक्स रेसिंग के चौंकाने वाले खतरों को दुखद रूप से रेखांकित किया, एक ऐसा खेल जिसने 1976 तक 63 ड्राइवरों की जान ले ली थी। लाउडा की अविश्वसनीय वापसी और हंट के साथ उनकी महान प्रतिद्वंद्विता को बाद में 2013 की रॉन हॉवर्ड की फिल्म ""रश"" में नाटकीय रूप दिया गया।",en,[],,"The F1 champion Niki Lauda had a near-fatal accident in Germany in August 1976.

Sir John Wolfenden was unprepared for the backlash that his dry, academic 155-page government report would provoke. ""All sorts of people said all sorts of things, and all sorts of people wrote all sorts of things on the pavement outside our house,"" he told BBC radio. ""I have from one religious sect an official curse. Typed."" He was surprised by how ""violent"" the press reaction was: ""I didn't expect it to make as much splash as it did."" When The Report of the Departmental Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution – better known as the Wolfenden Report – came out on 4 September 1957, it flew off the shelves, selling out its first print run of 5,000 copies within hours. It also provoked a fierce public debate in Britain, contrary to what the government had hoped. WATCH: 'We are concerned primarily with public order and not with private morality'. Home Secretary Sir David Maxwell Fyfe had been prompted to set up the committee by the government's discomfort with two issues. The first was the visibility of sex workers on London's streets, the second was the rising number of men arrested for homosexual acts, which were illegal at the time in the UK. This rise had been triggered by Maxwell Fyfe's own policy of the deliberate entrapment and arrest of gay men by the police.","Sixty-eight years ago this week, on September 4, 1957, the landmark Wolfenden Report was published, advocating for the decriminalization of male homosexuality while also leading to a crackdown on sex workers. Authored by Sir John Wolfenden, the ""Report of the Departmental Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution"" was commissioned by Home Secretary Sir David Maxwell Fyfe. This was prompted by government discomfort over the increasing visibility of sex workers and a rise in arrests for homosexual acts—a surge partly attributed to Maxwell Fyfe's own policy of police entrapment.

Despite its dry, academic nature and Wolfenden's stated principle of focusing on ""public order and not with private morality,"" the report triggered an unexpectedly ""violent"" and widespread public backlash and press uproar. It sold out its initial print run within hours but also earned Wolfenden personal condemnation, including a religious curse.","अड़सठ साल पहले इसी सप्ताह, 4 सितंबर, 1957 को, ऐतिहासिक वुल्फेंडेन रिपोर्ट प्रकाशित हुई थी, जिसने पुरुष समलैंगिकता को अपराध की श्रेणी से बाहर करने की वकालत की, लेकिन साथ ही सेक्स वर्करों पर शिकंजा कसने का भी कारण बनी। सर जॉन वुल्फेंडेन द्वारा लिखित, ""समलैंगिक अपराधों और वेश्यावृत्ति पर विभागीय समिति की रिपोर्ट"" गृह सचिव सर डेविड मैक्सवेल फ़ाइफ़ के आदेश पर तैयार की गई थी।

यह पहल सरकार की उस असहजता के कारण हुई थी जो सेक्स वर्करों की बढ़ती दृश्यता और समलैंगिक कृत्यों के लिए गिरफ़्तारियों में वृद्धि से उपजी थी—एक ऐसी वृद्धि जिसे आंशिक रूप से मैक्सवेल फ़ाइफ़ की अपनी पुलिस द्वारा जाल बिछाकर फँसाने की नीति का परिणाम माना जाता है।

It was Epstein who was Lennon's best man when he married his first wife Cynthia Powell in 1962, paying for their celebratory meal afterwards and providing his flat on Falkner Street in Liverpool for the couple to live in rent-free while they had their first child, Julian. ""I think they're all great people, and I really mean that,"" Epstein told Grundy. ""It was recently written about me that I probably enjoy best the company of my artists, and I think that's quite true, actually. It was written in a context where I don't have much of a social life and that most of my time is spent with my artists."" Within 10 months of Epstein starting to manage The Beatles, they had released their first single, Love Me Do. In March 1963, their second single, Please Please Me, from their album of the same name, would reach number one in the UK charts. By the end of 1963, Epstein was negotiating to secure The Beatles their first US television appearance on Ed Sullivan's top-rated CBS entertainment show. The band's February 1964 performance would prove to be a cultural watershed, drawing some 73 million viewers. There was an explosion of fan hysteria, with The Beatles simultaneously holding the top five positions on the Billboard chart by April. The talent was theirs, but he gave them every opportunity to use it – Mark Lewisohn But in the years that followed, as The Beatles grew ever more successful internationally, Epstein's personal life became increasingly chaotic. To cope with his workload, he began to take stimulants, which he would then balance with sedatives to help him sleep. By the end of 1966, the band themselves were fatigued and decided to stop touring. Throughout 1967, while The Beatles worked on their groundbreaking Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album, Epstein would be in and out of a private clinic in London, the Priory, in an attempt to deal with his drug dependency. But he would still keep up his demanding schedule, leaving the Priory to host the Sgt Pepper's launch party at his Belgravia, London home in May 1967, and negotiating for The Beatles to perform of All You Need Is Love for 400 million viewers in 25 countries on the world's first satellite television link. A little over a month after his father died, Epstein was found dead at the age of 32 in August 1967, having taken what was ruled to be an accidental drug overdose. The Beatles were left reeling. While the wisdom of some of his business decisions has been questioned, not least by The Beatles themselves, he had kept the band on track. ""I knew that we were in trouble then,"" John Lennon told Rolling Stone's Jann Wenner in a 1970 interview. Lennon believed that Epstein's death had triggered the band's disintegration. ""I didn't really have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music, and I was scared. I thought, 'We've had it now.'"" Less than three years after his death, The Beatles had broken up.","Brian Epstein, the visionary manager of The Beatles, played a pivotal and deeply personal role in the band's meteoric rise to global stardom before his untimely death in 1967.

Establishing a close bond, particularly with John Lennon – for whom he served as best man and provided housing – Epstein viewed his artists as his primary social circle, stating he ""probably enjoy best the company of my artists.""

His astute management quickly transformed the band's prospects. Within 10 months of taking the helm, The Beatles released their first single, ""Love Me Do,"" followed by the UK chart-topping ""Please Please Me"" in March 1963. Epstein was instrumental in securing their iconic U.S. television debut on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" in February 1964, a cultural watershed viewed by 73 million and initiating ""Beatlemania,"" with the band soon dominating the Billboard charts.

However, the immense pressure took its toll on Epstein's personal life, which grew increasingly chaotic. He relied on a regimen of stimulants and sedatives and frequently sought treatment at private clinics, even as the band themselves became fatigued and ceased touring by late 1966.

In August 1967, at just 32 years old, Epstein died from an accidental drug overdose, shortly after hosting the launch party for ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" His death left The Beatles reeling, with John Lennon later stating he ""knew we were in trouble then"" and attributing the band's subsequent disintegration – which occurred less than three years later – to Epstein's absence.

Despite some later criticisms of his business decisions, Epstein is widely credited for keeping the band focused and enabling their extraordinary talent to reach the world.","बीटल्स के दूरदर्शी प्रबंधक ब्रायन एपस्टीन ने 1967 में अपनी असामयिक मृत्यु से पहले बैंड को वैश्विक स्टारडम तक पहुंचाने में एक केंद्रीय और बेहद व्यक्तिगत भूमिका निभाई।

उन्होंने जॉन लेनन के साथ एक गहरा संबंध स्थापित किया, जिनके वे बेस्ट मैन भी बने और जिन्हें उन्होंने आवास भी प्रदान किया। एपस्टीन अपने कलाकारों को अपना प्राथमिक सामाजिक दायरा मानते थे, उन्होंने कहा था कि ""मैं शायद अपने कलाकारों की संगति का सबसे अधिक आनंद लेता हूँ।""

उनके कुशल प्रबंधन ने बैंड की संभावनाओं को तेज़ी से बदल दिया। बागडोर संभालने के 10 महीनों के भीतर, बीटल्स ने अपना पहला एकल गीत ""लव मी डू"" जारी किया, जिसके बाद मार्च 1963 में यूके चार्ट में शीर्ष पर रहने वाला ""प्लीज प्लीज मी"" आया। फरवरी 1964 में ""द एड सुलिवन शो"" में उनके प्रतिष्ठित अमेरिकी टेलीविजन पदार्पण को सुनिश्चित करने में एपस्टीन की महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका थी। यह एक सांस्कृतिक मोड़ था जिसे 73 मिलियन लोगों ने देखा और इसने ""बीटलमेनिया"" की शुरुआत की, जिसके साथ बैंड ने जल्द ही बिलबोर्ड चार्ट पर अपना दबदबा बना लिया।

हालांकि, इस भारी दबाव ने एपस्टीन के निजी जीवन पर बुरा असर डाला, जो तेज़ी से अस्त-व्यस्त होता चला गया। वह उत्तेजक और शामक दवाओं के एक नियम पर निर्भर रहने लगे और अक्सर निजी क्लीनिकों में इलाज के लिए जाते थे, जबकि बैंड खुद भी थक चुका था और 1966 के अंत तक उसने दौरा करना बंद कर दिया था।

अगस्त 1967 में, मात्र 32 वर्ष की आयु में, एपस्टीन की ""सार्जेंट पेपर'स लोनली हार्ट्स क्लब बैंड"" के लॉन्च पार्टी की मेजबानी करने के तुरंत बाद आकस्मिक ड्रग ओवरडोज से मृत्यु हो गई। उनकी मृत्यु से बीटल्स को गहरा सदमा लगा, जॉन लेनन ने बाद में कहा कि ""मुझे पता था कि हम तब मुश्किल में थे"" और बैंड के बाद के विघटन - जो तीन साल से भी कम समय बाद हुआ - का कारण एपस्टीन की अनुपस्थिति को बताया।

उनके व्यावसायिक निर्णयों की कुछ बाद की आलोचनाओं के बावजूद, एपस्टीन को बैंड को केंद्रित रखने और उनकी असाधारण प्रतिभा को दुनिया तक पहुंचाने में सक्षम बनाने का व्यापक रूप से श्रेय दिया जाता है।",en,[],,"Brian Epstein guided the Fab Four from the Cavern Club to global fame.

And I can remember saying to myself, 'By God, I've had it now.'"" In fact, Powers managed to parachute to safety, but his troubles were far from over. Having been arrested and interrogated by the KGB, he was put on trial in Moscow, where his family could only watch helplessly. ""He said that he knew that we were present at his trial,"" his wife Barbara Powers told the BBC. ""He didn't know beforehand. But he saw me wave. And he said he just couldn't bear to look towards the box where we were all sitting, because it upset him too much, and he knew it would upset us."" On 19 August 1960, 65 years ago this week, Powers was sentenced to 10 years – three in a Russian prison and seven in a labour camp. His capture and trial would have a devastating impact on East-West relations at the height of the Cold War. Powers was 30 at the time. A coal miner's son from Kentucky, US, he studied chemistry and biology before joining the US Air Force in 1950. In 1956, he was recruited by the CIA to pilot U-2 spy planes over enemy territory. These U-2s could fly at 70,000ft (21.3km), which was supposedly above the range of Soviet defences, and yet the cutting-edge camera on board could take detailed photographs of military installations far below. On 1 May 1960, Powers took off from Peshawar, Pakistan, with a brief to fly across the USSR and land in Norway. ""The planned route would take us deeper into Russia than we had ever gone, while traversing important targets never before photographed,"" he wrote in his memoir, Operation Overflight.","The 1960 capture and trial of US pilot Francis Gary Powers became a major Cold War diplomatic disaster, significantly worsening East-West relations.

That proposal was put on hold, but Vicky Roden said she is concerned the decision will be reviewed for the coming financial year. Last year, Walsall Council said it wanted to move it from its current location on Littleton Street West to an unconfirmed council-owned building in the town centre. An artist is planning to demonstrate against proposals to relocate a town's leather museum at a major cultural event. Ms Roden said the museum was important to the town and also to her personally. She said: ""Being able to access this locally and without financial cost meant I was able to go there when feeling low and find something to relate to at some of the worst points in my life."" On Saturday, she plans to stand on a soapbox at 14:00 BST to deliver an hour-long ""impassioned public speech about the value of culture and heritage in Walsall"". She said her aim was to ""raise awareness of the incredibly shaky future of both Walsall Leather Museum and museum services in Walsall"". The museum, which celebrates the town's leather-making history, is based in a Victorian building that was once a leather-making factory. It explains the leatherworking process, featuring artefacts from local people and telling personal stories. The council proposal to move it to a new location could save the council £190,000, but following protests it was halted in February by former leader Garry Perry. Ms Roden said the protests earlier in the year had been a ""magnificent display of people power"". She said she now wanted the council to be transparent about the plans and what could happen next. MakerFest, which the council describes as a ""vibrant celebration of the creativity and talent"" attracted more than 50,000 people into the town centre last year. A spokesperson for Walsall Council said: ""While we fully respect the right to peaceful protest, it's disappointing that a protest may occur during MakerFest this Saturday."" It said a lot of planning had gone into the day and it added: ""Discussions regarding Walsall Leather Museum are ongoing, and we hope Vicky and all our residents will continue to engage with us.""","Artist Vicky Roden is planning a public protest at Walsall's major cultural event, MakerFest, this Saturday to oppose the potential relocation of the Walsall Leather Museum. The museum, housed in a historic Victorian leather factory, celebrates the town's rich leather-making heritage and holds significant cultural and personal value, offering free local access.

Walsall Council had previously proposed moving the museum from its Littleton Street West location to an unconfirmed council-owned building to save £190,000, but these plans were halted in February following public outcry. However, Roden fears the decision may be revisited for the upcoming financial year and demands transparency from the council regarding its future.

She plans to deliver a one-hour monologue on a soapbox at 2 PM BST, aiming to raise awareness about the ""incredibly shaky future"" of the museum and local museum services. While Walsall Council respects the right to peaceful protest, a spokesperson expressed disappointment that it would occur during MakerFest, a ""vibrant celebration"" attracting over 50,000 people. The council stated that discussions regarding the museum are ongoing and encouraged continued engagement.","**कलाकार विक्की रोडन इस शनिवार को वॉलसॉल के प्रमुख सांस्कृतिक कार्यक्रम मेकरफेस्ट में एक सार्वजनिक विरोध प्रदर्शन की योजना बना रही हैं, जिसका उद्देश्य वॉलसॉल लेदर म्यूज़ियम के संभावित स्थानांतरण का विरोध करना है। यह संग्रहालय, जो एक ऐतिहासिक विक्टोरियन चमड़े के कारखाने में स्थित है, शहर की समृद्ध चमड़ा बनाने की विरासत का सम्मान करता है और महत्वपूर्ण सांस्कृतिक तथा व्यक्तिगत मूल्य रखता है, साथ ही स्थानीय लोगों को निःशुल्क पहुँच प्रदान करता है।**

This would follow the lead of the Irish broadcaster, RTÉ, which has said it will not take part if Israel does ""given the ongoing and appalling loss of lives in Gaza"". Mr Coulter said he was ""100% behind RTÉ"" in their decision to withdraw from the contest, and that people in the UK and Ireland are both ""disgusted by what's going on in Gaza"". He has written or co-written several songs for Eurovision, including the UK's winning song ""Puppet on a String"" in 1967, which singer Jade Thirlwall used a sample of in a song last year. The BBC has declined to comment. RTÉ will make a final decision once the Eurovision organiser, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), makes its decision. The Netherlands has joined the potential boycott and other nations have confirmed they are considering it, depending on the EBU's decision. Nicky Stevens, from British band and Eurovision 1976 winner Brotherhood of Man, said while she is horrified by what is happening in Gaza, it would be ""a shame"" for politics to be ""brought into"" Eurovision. ""Let's all get together for one night and just focus on the music,"" she said. Bambie Thug, Ireland's Eurovision entry in 2024, echoed Mr Coulter's sentiment. ""I fully support RTE's decision to not take part in the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest and I hope this can set an example for other countries,"" they said. Last year, Bambie Thug was one of a number of contestants to complain of a ""tense"" and ""horrible"" atmosphere backstage. After the grand final, Bambie Thug also accused Israel's national broadcaster, Kan, of ""inciting violence"" against them during its coverage. Kan said the Israeli delegation faced an ""unprecedented display of hatred"" from other countries and their entrants. EPA Yuval Raphael flew the flag for Israel at this year's song contest in Switzerland Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, Mr Coulter said he feels ""very strongly"" about Ireland not participating in Eurovision if Israel does, due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza. ""Musicians, songwriters and performers are human beings with consciences. ""I think the only sensible thing and the only decent thing for RTÉ to do is to withdraw from the contest if Israel is allowed to perform."" He said there was a ""double standard"" that Israel was being allowed to participate whereas Russia was expelled from the 2022 contest due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. ""What's the difference between that tragic event and what's happening in Gaza?"" Mr Coulter asked. He also said that the BBC should take a similar position to RTÉ and not participate in next year's Eurovision. ""I think it is a question of conscience, and as RTÉ have made this step - it reflects the feeling of the general public and I'm quite sure that throughout the United Kingdom people are equally disgusted by what's going on in Gaza,"" Mr Coulter told the programme. Asked later to clarify whether he meant the BBC should withdraw if Israel continues to participate, he said yes. Next year's contest will be held in May in Vienna. Dutch broadcaster AVROTROS announced on Friday that it will also boycott next year's contest if Israel is included. Spain and Slovenia are considering similar moves, while a spokeswoman for the Finnish national broadcaster said a decision regarding the broadcaster's participation in next year's Eurovision will be ""made in December"". ""Israel's participation in Eurovision has been a significant topic of discussion in Finland,"" she said. ""The humanitarian situation in Gaza is tragic, and we sincerely hope for an end to the suffering as soon as possible."" A spokesman for Iceland's national broadcaster said its involvement in the 2026 contest was ""subject to the outcome of the ongoing consultation process within the EBU, due to the participation of the Israeli state broadcaster KAN in the competition"" and that they ""reserve the right to withdraw from participation in it if the EBU does not respond satisfactorily"". In a statement on Thursday, RTÉ said: ""It is RTÉ's position that Ireland will not take part in the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest, if the participation of Israel goes ahead, and the final decision regarding Ireland's participation will be made once the EBU's decision is made"". It added: ""RTÉ is also deeply concerned by the targeted killing of journalists in Gaza, the denial of access to international journalists to the territory, and the plight of the remaining hostages."" Ireland has won the contest seven times in total, most recently in 1996. Getty Images Director of the Eurovision Song Contest, Martin Green said the EBU ""understand the concerns""","Veteran UK songwriter Phil Coulter has called for the UK to withdraw from the Eurovision Song Contest if Israel participates, mirroring the stance of Irish broadcaster RTÉ. RTÉ has announced it will not take part due to the ""ongoing and appalling loss of lives in Gaza,"" a decision strongly supported by Ireland's 2024 entry, Bambie Thug, who also cited past negative experiences with Israel's national broadcaster, Kan.

Coulter highlighted a ""double standard,"" noting that Russia was expelled from the 2022 contest following its invasion of Ukraine, questioning the allowance of Israel's participation amidst the Gaza conflict. The Netherlands has joined a potential boycott, with Spain, Slovenia, Finland, and Iceland also considering similar moves or reserving the right to withdraw, pending a decision from the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).

The BBC has declined to comment on Coulter's suggestions.

अनुभवी ब्रिटिश गीतकार फिल कूल्टर ने यूके से आग्रह किया है कि अगर इज़राइल यूरोविज़न गीत प्रतियोगिता में भाग लेता है तो वह इससे हट जाए, जो आयरिश ब्रॉडकास्टर आरटीई के समान ही रुख है। आरटीई ने गाजा में ""जानमाल के लगातार और भयानक नुकसान"" का हवाला देते हुए घोषणा की है कि वह इसमें भाग नहीं लेगा। आयरलैंड की 2024 की प्रविष्टि, बैम्बी ठग, ने इस निर्णय का दृढ़ता से समर्थन किया है, और उन्होंने इज़राइल के राष्ट्रीय प्रसारक, कान, के साथ अपने पिछले नकारात्मक अनुभवों का भी उल्लेख किया।

कूल्टर ने ""दोहरे मापदंड"" की बात कही, यह ध्यान दिलाते हुए कि रूस को यूक्रेन पर उसके आक्रमण के बाद 2022 की प्रतियोगिता से बाहर कर दिया गया था, और गाजा संघर्ष के बीच इज़राइल की भागीदारी की अनुमति पर सवाल उठाया। नीदरलैंड्स एक संभावित बहिष्कार में शामिल हो गया है, जबकि स्पेन, स्लोवेनिया, फिनलैंड और आइसलैंड भी यूरोपीय प्रसारण संघ (ईबीयू) के फैसले का इंतज़ार करते हुए इसी तरह के कदम उठाने या हटने का अधिकार सुरक्षित रखने पर विचार कर रहे हैं।

बीबीसी ने कूल्टर के सुझावों पर टिप्पणी करने से इनकार कर दिया है। हालांकि, गायिका निक्की स्टीवंस ने गाजा की स्थिति पर अपनी पीड़ा व्यक्त की, उन्होंने यूरोविज़न से राजनीति को दूर रखने की वकालत की ताकि संगीत पर ध्यान केंद्रित किया जा सके। ईबीयू, जो ""चिंताओं को समझता है"", इज़राइल की भागीदारी और अन्य राष्ट्रों की प्रविष्टियों के संबंध में अंतिम निर्णय लेगा।",en,[],,The songwriter said people in the UK and Ireland are 'equally disgusted by what's going on in Gaza'.,[''],www.bbc.com/culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 16-year-old has enjoyed the country dance style since she was seven, following in the footsteps of her mum, grandmother and great-grandmother. She's one of many line dancers who say perceptions of the dance have shifted dramatically in recent years - from being associated with pensioners, to an explosive social media trend. Many attribute the boom to country-pop being back in the charts, with mainstream artists like Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan leaning into the genre. ""Country is cool again,"" says fellow line dancer Natalie Lake. Ava runs a line dancing business of her own and teaches three classes a week. She also shares video tutorials on TikTok which have racked up thousands of views. ""[Line dancing has] massively changed,"" says Ava, from Newport in south Wales. ""I remember being in a class and I'd be the youngest one there... in my lessons now, we get loads of kids, loads of teenagers and adults."" Steffi Andrews Photography Ava says her line dancing classes attract a wide range of ages Ava says social media is a big part of her inspiration, adding ""everything is coming off TikTok"" these days. ""Whatever happens in the USA with line dancing, that's how we get all our dances,"" she says. Ava's mum, Marie, says line dancing used to carry a ""stigma"". ""When I would go with my mum and I was in high school, you wouldn't tell anyone you were doing line dancing,"" Marie recalls. 'The stereotype has broken' BBC Wales' weather presenter Sabrina Lee dons her check shirt and cowboy boots at her line dancing class Line dancing involves people following a choreographed set of steps while arranged in lines, facing the instructor. It has no single origin, but draws on folk dance traditions across Europe and Africa and was consolidated as a dance style within the US country music scene in the 20th Century. As a low-impact exercise that doesn't require a partner, it became popular with older people when it first migrated to the UK - but it appears that's all changing. Each track also has a set dance so, once someone has learned the steps, they can join in with it at any dance hall - worldwide. Marie Stratford-Davies When Ava began line dancing, she went with her mum, grandmother and great-grandmother Natalie, who is 41, says she would once have been the youngest person in the room at a line dancing event. But at a recent gathering she had a ""culture shock"" when she realised she was actually the oldest attendee. ""It's really nice to see that the stereotype has been broken and that we're not village halls of retired people,"" says Natalie, from Neath. Natalie used to be a ""prolific"" line dancer during her childhood, but gave up after thinking ""it wasn't cool"". Natalie Lake Natalie Lake (left) says line dancing has hugely changed since her childhood That all changed two years ago, when she bumped into an old friend who encouraged her to return. Natalie says the dance has changed significantly in the past 20 years and no longer fits into ""a niche box"", with routines to everything from Metallica to Abba and Ed Sheeran. She says newer country artists - such as Lainey Wilson, Ella Langley and Megan Maroney - were showing ""the days of fringes and acoustic guitars and standing on the stage with as many rhinestones as possible singing about losing your dog and a divorce"" are long gone. TikTok dance trends, to songs like Dasha's Austin and Sabrina Carpenter's Manchild, also feature line dancing steps. Many have jumped on these trends without even realising they are taking part in the dance style. Luke Shrimpton Social line dancing is becoming more and more popular with younger people, say those who enjoy the hobby ""I think that's definitely put [line dancing] into the views of more people than it would have reached before,"" says Natalie. Amy Ray-Jones, 29, who grew up listening to country music, started line dancing earlier this year and says social media has been ""a huge help"" in widening the scope. ""We don't just dance to country, which I think is some of the appeal too... I know so many dances to Pitbull songs."" Amy, from Flintshire, says meeting people is another crucial element of her ""addiction"" to line dancing. ""As a woman in her late 20s, it's quite hard to make friends... [but] there's always someone free to dance with. ""It's honestly the most fun I've had."" Amy Ray-Jones Amy Ray-Jones says she would line dance every day if she could Line dancing last had a resurgence in the 1990s following the release of Billy Rae Cyrus's Achy Breaky Heart. It was then that Luke Shrimpton, then 10 years old, first got a taste for it. ""I went to a country music night with my best friend and his parents. I was bored, so I started copying the dances on the floor,"" he recalls. The 39-year-old NHS worker now teaches line dancing four nights a week and puts rising demand down to artists such as Post Malone, Shaboozey and Luke Combs popularising country or country-inspired tracks. ""It's just gone from strength to strength,"" says Luke, from Swansea. Luke Shrimpton Luke Shrimpton met his wife Amy through his line dancing, and his children now take part too ""The younger generation are getting hooked on country in a way we never did... It's becoming more socially acceptable to like country music,"" he says. Luke met his wife through line dancing and their three children now take part too. ""I feel lucky and privileged that it's been part of my life."" '8,000 steps in two hours'","Line dancing is experiencing a significant resurgence, particularly among younger generations, dramatically shedding its former stereotype as an activity exclusively for older people. This boom is largely driven by the return of country-pop music to mainstream charts and the powerful influence of social media platforms like TikTok, where line dancing steps are often featured in viral trends.

Sixteen-year-old Ava Stratford-Davies, who runs her own line dancing business, teaches classes, and shares popular video tutorials on TikTok and YouTube, exemplifies this shift. She notes a dramatic change in class demographics, now seeing ""loads of kids, teenagers and adults"" where she once was the youngest. This sentiment is echoed by fellow dancers and Ava's mother, who recalls a past ""stigma"" around the activity.

The dance's appeal has broadened beyond traditional country music, with routines now set to genres ranging from Metallica to Pitbull. Participants like Natalie Lake highlight that ""the stereotype has broken,"" transforming it from ""village halls of retired people"" to a ""new hobby"" with diverse appeal. Amy Ray-Jones, 29, praises its social benefits, making it easier to connect with people and forming a supportive community.

The accessibility of line dancing—as a low-impact exercise that doesn't require a partner, and with universal steps for each track—contributes to its growing popularity. Even seasoned dancers like Luke Shrimpton, 39, who teaches multiple classes a week, have witnessed an unprecedented demand, with the younger generation now ""hooked on country"" in a way previous ones weren't, making line dancing ""more socially acceptable"" and inclusive.","लाइन डांसिंग में एक महत्वपूर्ण पुनरुत्थान देखने को मिल रहा है, खासकर युवा पीढ़ियों के बीच। इसने अपनी उस पुरानी रूढ़िवादी छवि को नाटकीय रूप से त्याग दिया है, जिसमें इसे विशेष रूप से बुजुर्गों की गतिविधि माना जाता था। इस उछाल का मुख्य कारण कंट्री-पॉप संगीत का मुख्यधारा के चार्ट्स पर वापस आना और टिकटॉक जैसे सोशल मीडिया प्लेटफॉर्म का शक्तिशाली प्रभाव है, जहाँ लाइन डांसिंग के स्टेप्स अक्सर वायरल ट्रेंड्स में शामिल होते हैं।

इस नृत्य की अपील पारंपरिक कंट्री संगीत से कहीं आगे बढ़ गई है, अब इसकी नृत्य दिनचर्या मेटालिका से लेकर पिटबुल तक के विभिन्न शैलियों पर निर्धारित होती है। नताली लेक जैसे प्रतिभागी इस बात पर जोर देते हैं कि ""रूढ़िवादिता टूट गई है"", जिससे यह ""सेवानिवृत्त लोगों के ग्राम्य हॉल"" की गतिविधि से बदलकर विविध अपील वाला ""एक नया शौक"" बन गया है। 29 वर्षीया एमी रे-जोन्स इसके सामाजिक लाभों की प्रशंसा करती हैं, यह लोगों से जुड़ना आसान बनाता है और एक सहायक समुदाय का निर्माण करता है।

लाइन डांसिंग की सुलभता — एक कम-प्रभाव वाले व्यायाम के रूप में जिसमें साथी की आवश्यकता नहीं होती, और हर ट्रैक के लिए सार्वभौमिक स्टेप्स के साथ — इसकी बढ़ती लोकप्रियता में योगदान करती है। सप्ताह में कई कक्षाएं पढ़ाने वाले 39 वर्षीय अनुभवी नर्तक ल्यूक श्रिम्प्टन जैसे लोगों ने भी अभूतपूर्व मांग देखी है। उनका कहना है कि युवा पीढ़ी अब ""कंट्री संगीत की दीवानी हो गई है"" जिस तरह पिछली पीढ़ियां नहीं थीं, जिससे लाइन डांसिंग ""अधिक सामाजिक रूप से स्वीकार्य"" और समावेशी बन गया है।",en,[],,"Fuelled by social media trends and country-pop in the charts, line dancing is enjoying a resurgence.",[''],www.bbc.com/culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'What do I get to do?'."" The stars taking part do have some excellent jokes and several of these big names are sending themselves up mercilessly. If there was an Emmy for ""best sport"", Kravitz would be a shoo-in for her antics in one episode when she accidentally gets high on drugs. The hero's dilemma Rogen's Remick is an executive who has worked at the fictional Continental Studios for 22 years. He's a movie nerd; the sort of cinephile who will bend your ear about the incredible funeral shot in 1960s political epic Soy Cuba or wax lyrical about the ""magical"" properties of real film stock. He relaxes by watching Goodfellas for the millionth time. He yearns to make the next Annie Hall or Rosemary's Baby. He loves being around actors and directors and is desperate for their approval but as a studio guy – a suit, a bean-counter – the creatives only ever want to keep him at arm's length. Instead of hanging out with Hollywood's coolest, he has to take meetings with the Rubik's Cube people and the Jenga people because Continental is focused on making trashy popcorn movies with ""known brands"". There are enough easter eggs and in-jokes to delight the most knowledgeable of film fans When the Continental head is fired after a string of box office bombs, the unpredictable CEO, Griffin Mill (Bryan Cranston), selects Matt to replace her. Mill has secured the movie rights to Kool-Aid, the soft-drink mix. He reasons that if a Barbie film can make a billion dollars for Warner Bros, Matt should be able to make money from a movie about the Kool Aid man, the drink's animated marketing mascot. Matt sets to work in the belief that prestige films and box office hits are not mutually exclusive but in a world where TikTok trends dictate film-making decisions, he's quickly forced to question that ideal. He has a major problem in that he can't square his admiration for cinema legends with the need to make hard-nosed business decisions. He can't bring himself to tell Ron Howard that the last act of his latest movie sucks. He can't break it to Martin Scorsese that the studio won't be making his script about cult leader Jim Jones.","Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen have co-created a new series in which Rogen stars as Remick, a long-serving executive at the fictional Continental Studios. Remick is a passionate cinephile who dreams of producing critically acclaimed films, but his role as a ""suit"" forces him to greenlight commercial ""popcorn movies"" based on ""known brands"" like Kool-Aid, a strategy championed by new CEO Griffin Mill after the success of *Barbie*.

The show explores Remick's struggle to reconcile his love for cinema legends with the pragmatic, TikTok-driven demands of modern Hollywood. He finds himself unable to deliver honest feedback to figures like Ron Howard or to greenlight Martin Scorsese's script about Jim Jones. The series features excellent, self-deprecating humor from its stars, with Zoë Kravitz singled out for her memorable antics in an episode where she accidentally gets high. It also includes numerous ""easter eggs"" and in-jokes designed to delight film enthusiasts.

Owen Cooper, the 15-year-old British star of Adolescence, Netflix's series about a teenager accused of murdering a classmate, could become the youngest male actor ever to win an Emmy. Elsewhere, a campaign led by US chat show hosts following the cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert could see the programme win outstanding talk series for the first time. The ceremony will take place on Sunday evening at the Peacock Theatre in Los Angeles. The Studio, Andor, Hacks, Slow Horses, The Bear, Nobody Wants This and The Last of Us are among the other shows competing for the top prizes. Here's everything you need to know ahead of TV's biggest night: Who is hosting the Emmys? Getty Images Nate Bargatze, pictured on stage at the Golden Globes in January, is known for his family-friendly comic style US comedian Nate Bargatze is this year's Emmys host. He may not be a household name in the UK, but Bargatze is well known to American viewers and he sold more tickets to his shows than any other stand-up in the US last year. As well as his own TV stand-up specials, Bargatze has appeared on a string of late-night talk shows including Seth Meyers, Conan O'Brien and Jimmy Fallon, as well as variety show Saturday Night Live. The 46-year-old is unlikely to go the Ricky Gervais route with a controversial opening monologue. He is known as a more family-friendly comedian who often uses observational humour. Bargatze has said it is a ""huge honour"" to be hosting the event, and he has some interesting rules too. He plans to tell nominees that he will donate $100,000 to charity on the night, but the donation will decrease for every acceptance speech that goes over the time limit. ""So is thanking your second manager worth taking food from a child?"" he asked. ""I don't think so, but we'll see what Hollywood thinks."" Which TV shows are nominated? Getty Images Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri are both nominated again for their performances in The Bear The Emmys split their nominations into three categories: comedy, drama and limited series. Outstanding drama is traditionally seen as the most prestigious award of the night, and the field is wide open this year in the absence of last year's winner Shogun, which has not yet started production on its next season. Instead, this year's contenders include wealth satire The White Lotus, Star Wars spin-off Andor, dystopian drama Paradise and sci-fi thriller Severance. They are joined in the category by video game adaptation The Last of Us, medical series The Pitt, espionage drama Slow Horses and political thriller The Diplomat. The comedy categories see two former winners compete to take the title again - kitchen drama The Bear and entertainment satire Hacks. Getty Images British actress Aimee Lou Wood is nominated for The White Lotus, as is her co-star Walton Goggins They face competition from the school-based Abbott Elementary, romantic comedy Nobody Wants This, and crime mystery Only Murders in the Building. The category is completed by vampire mockumentary What We Do in the Shadows, therapist comedy Shrinking and Hollywood satire The Studio. Emmys 2025: The key nominees Meanwhile, the limited and anthology series category is led by Adolescence, a show which enjoyed as many headlines for its one-take shooting style as it did for its exploration of the impact of smartphones' on teenagers. It faces competition from the dystopian Black Mirror, Batman spin-off The Penguin, erotic cancer comedy Dying for Sex, and true-crime adaptation Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story. Record breakers and controversies Getty Images Roxana Zal, pictured in 1984's Something About Amelia, is the youngest ever Emmy winner for acting At 15, Cooper would not be the youngest winner for acting in Emmys history. That record is held by Roxana Zal who was 14 when she won in 1984 for her role in TV movie Something About Amelia. Other notable teenage winners over the years include Kristy McNichol and Scott Jacoby, while the list of youngest nominees includes Frankie Muniz, Claire Danes, Millie Bobby Brown and Keshia Knight Pulliam, who was just six when she was nominated for The Cosby Show. But Cooper would be the youngest ever winner in his category - best supporting actor in a limited series - as well as the youngest male winner overall in any acting category. Other supporting actors and actresses nominated at the Emmys this year include Aimee Lou Wood, Walton Goggins, Jason Isaacs, Catherine O'Hara, Sam Rockwell, Colman Domingo, Harrison Ford, Javier Bardem and Erin Doherty. In the lead categories, nominees include Cate Blanchett, Jake Gyllenhaal, Colin Farrell, Ayo Edebiri, Jean Smart, Kathy Bates, Jeremy Allen White, Bella Ramsey, Gary Oldman, Pedro Pascal, Michelle Williams and Stephen Graham. Getty Images Kimmel (right), pictured with Colbert at the 2019 Emmys, has said his fellow nominee should win best talk show There is also a lot of interest in the variety talk series category this year, after a turbulent year for the late-night circuit. CBS announced in July that it would be cancelling The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, which he has hosted since 2015. The network said it was a financial decision, but there was surprise in the industry given its relative popularity, and some suggested political pressure might have played a role in its cancellation. Other talk show hosts, including some of Colbert's fellow nominees, have publicly supported him by saying they will be voting for him at the Emmys this year, and have encouraged others to do the same. A billboard ad in West Hollywood taken out last month by Jimmy Kimmel, one of Colbert's rivals in the category, saw the talk show host declare: ""I'm voting for Stephen."" The Late Show already won its first Emmy last week, when it won a directing prize at the Creative Arts Emmys, a separate ceremony which precedes the main event. How to watch the Emmy Awards Getty Images Abbott Elementary's Quinta Brunson (left) and Sheryl Lee Ralph are among the comedy series nominees","The Emmy Awards are set to take place this Sunday evening at the Peacock Theatre in Los Angeles, hosted by US comedian Nate Bargatze. Known for his family-friendly observational humor, Bargatze has announced a unique plan to donate $100,000 to charity on the night, with the amount decreasing for every acceptance speech that goes over the time limit.

Anticipation is high for TV's biggest night, with several major shows competing across categories. In the prestigious Outstanding Drama Series category, contenders include ""The White Lotus,"" ""Andor,"" ""Severance,"" ""The Last of Us,"" ""Slow Horses,"" and ""The Diplomat."" For Outstanding Comedy Series, past winners ""The Bear"" and ""Hacks"" face competition from ""Abbott Elementary,"" ""Nobody Wants This,"" ""Only Murders in the Building,"" ""What We Do in the Shadows,"" ""Shrinking,"" and ""The Studio.""

The Limited and Anthology Series category sees ""Adolescence"" as a strong contender, up against ""Black Mirror,"" ""The Penguin,"" ""Dying for Sex,"" and ""Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story."" A significant storyline is 15-year-old Owen Cooper, star of ""Adolescence,"" who could make history as the youngest male actor ever to win an Emmy and the youngest overall in the Best Supporting Actor in a Limited Series category.

In the Variety Talk Series category, ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" is generating significant interest. Following its recent cancellation, rival talk show hosts, including Jimmy Kimmel, have publicly campaigned for Colbert to win, with Kimmel even taking out a billboard ad urging votes for him.

Notable acting nominees across categories include Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri for ""The Bear,"" Aimee Lou Wood for ""The White Lotus,"" as well as Cate Blanchett, Jake Gyllenhaal, Colin Farrell, Jean Smart, and Kathy Bates.","यहाँ अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

Why The White Lotus season three divided fans and critics,"Right from the start, season three of Mike White's Thailand-set one percenter drama was beset by criticism and debate – where will the series go from here? Within seconds of the highly anticipated final episode of The White Lotus’s season three ending on Sunday evening, the reactions and reviews for the 83-min closer were in. The viewers might as well have been talking about two different shows. ""This was the best season finale so far in The White Lotus universe,"" one person on X commented, while another agreed: ""That episode was a work of art."" However, others felt ""the ending was a huge flop – built up several plot lines all series to abruptly end them in 20 minutes with no reflection,"" with another saying the finale ""stinks… way too long, very boring"". These divisive opinions are reflective of the season as a whole, and were also felt by the critics. Was the third outing of creator Mike White's one-percenter holiday murder-mystery – set previously in luxury resorts in Hawaii, Sicily and, most recently, Koh Samui, Thailand – worthy of what Brian Tallerico of Roger Ebert called his ""favourite season yet""? Or did the series, as the Boston Globe's Steven Nguyen Scaife put it, have ""less to say than ever… it's comfort food masquerading as social critique""? It was always going to be a tricky feat for White to pull off mass adoration for a third time. The White Lotus, which debuted in 2021, previously won 15 Emmys and two Golden Globes. It marked a comeback role for Jennifer Coolidge, often credited as White's muse, and who portrayed the naive heiress Tanya McQuoid for the first two seasons. The role earned her two Emmys and a Golden Globe, as well as becoming a fan-favourite. But White had pulled the rug out from viewers at the end of season two, killing off Coolidge's much-loved character, leaving fans unsteady and unsure of where a third series would take them – and if it would still have the same impact.","The third season of Mike White's ""The White Lotus"" concluded Sunday night with its 83-minute finale, sparking significant debate and criticism among both viewers and critics. While some viewers lauded the ending as a ""work of art"" and the ""best season finale,"" others found it a ""huge flop"" that was ""boring"" and abruptly ended plot lines. Critics were similarly divided, with opinions ranging from ""favourite season yet"" to having ""less to say than ever.""

This divisive reception reflects the season as a whole, posing a considerable challenge for creator Mike White to replicate the show's prior success. The White Lotus previously won 15 Emmys and two Golden Globes, with Jennifer Coolidge earning two Emmys and a Golden Globe for her fan-favourite role as Tanya McQuoid, a character White killed off at the end of season two.","माइक व्हाइट की ""द व्हाइट लोटस"" का तीसरा सीज़न रविवार रात को अपने 83 मिनट के फिनाले (अंतिम एपिसोड) के साथ समाप्त हो गया, जिसने दर्शकों और समीक्षकों दोनों के बीच काफी बहस और आलोचना को जन्म दिया।

जहां कुछ दर्शकों ने इसके अंत को ""कला का एक अद्भुत नमूना"" और ""सीज़न का अब तक का सबसे बेहतरीन फिनाले"" बताया, वहीं अन्य ने इसे ""एक बड़ी फ्लॉप"" करार दिया जो ""उबाऊ"" था और जिसमें कहानी की कड़ियों को अचानक समाप्त कर दिया गया था। समीक्षक भी इसी तरह बंटे हुए थे, उनकी राय ""अब तक के पसंदीदा सीज़न"" से लेकर ""पहले से भी कम कहने को बचा है"" तक थी।

यह विभाजित प्रतिक्रिया पूरे सीज़न को दर्शाती है, जो निर्माता माइक व्हाइट के लिए शो की पिछली सफलता को दोहराने में एक बड़ी चुनौती पेश करती है। ""द व्हाइट लोटस"" ने पहले 15 एमी और दो गोल्डन ग्लोब जीते थे, जिसमें जेनिफर कूलिज ने अपनी प्रशंसक-पसंदीदा भूमिका तान्या मैकक्वायड के लिए दो एमी और एक गोल्डन ग्लोब जीता था, एक ऐसा किरदार जिसे व्हाइट ने दूसरे सीज़न के अंत में मार दिया था।",en,[],,"Right from the start, season three of Mike White's Thailand-set one percenter drama was beset by criticism and debate – where will the series go from here?",[''],www.bbc.com/culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sir Brian May and Roger Taylor joined the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the BBC Symphony Chorus to bring their scaramouches and fandangos to the Royal Albert Hall, as the song celebrated its 50th anniversary. Queen singer Freddie Mercury, who died in 1991, ""would have loved to be here"", Sir Brian told BBC News. ""He'd have been on that stage, lapping it up."" Asked what the flamboyant star would have worn, his bandmate replied: ""I think it would be formal. He wouldn't do the short shorts or the leotard. He'd be in tails, very elegant."" Brian May delivered the song's iconic guitar solo from a specially extended stage at the Royal Albert Hall Tenor Sam Oladeinde amply filled Mercury's high-top sneakers for Saturday's performance while the chorus was bolstered by the National Youth Choir, the BBC Singers and soprano Louise Alder for the famous ""Bismillah!"" section. Sir Brian momentarily missed his cue on the closing guitar solo but the climax - a ghostly recording of Mercury singing ""any way the wind blows"" followed by Roger Taylor striking Britain's largest gong - was met with a massive roar of approval. Stuart Morley's all-new orchestral arrangement gave Bohemian Rhapsody a ""fresh grandeur"", said chorister Gareth Malone, who watched the performance. ""This is a big room to fill, and it filled it."" Speaking backstage, Sir Brian called the performance ""very emotional"". ""A little too emotional for me,"" he added. ""I missed a couple of things which I wish would have loved to get better. But the overall feeling was great."" Bill Bailey played one of the evening's more unconventional instruments The Last Night marked the culmination of eight weeks of concerts across the country, from Bradford and Bristol to Gateshead and Belfast. The finale, at London's Royal Albert Hall, also starred comedian Bill Bailey, who played Leroy Anderson's 1950 classic The Typewriter on… well, a typewriter. A comedic ode to office life, it features just two keys of the machine (for clarity and to avoid jamming, apparently) as well as the ""ding"" of the carriage return at the end of each phrase. Known to many as the theme song to BBC Radio 4's The News Quiz, it was a quirky highlight that Bailey dedicated to his late mother. ""I just wish my mum was around for her to see it,"" he said ahead of the show. ""I think that would be just a wonderful moment - to see those early times when she inspired me to listen to music, and then there I am at the Proms."" Bailey was welcomed on stage by audience members, who chanted a greeting referencing ""Room 101"" - although their meaning was not immediately clear. Elim Chan conducted the Last Night concert for the first time The Last Night was led for the first time by Hong Kong-born conductor Elim Chan, who acknowledged her debut by hanging a learner's plate from her podium. But she was a confident, charismatic leader, who curated the concert around themes of childhood. The 38-year-old explained that she had been inspired to take up the baton after watching Mickey Mouse conducting the constellation of stars in Walt Disney's animated classic Fantasia. Accordingly, she included The Sorcerer's Apprentice, which scored that scene, as part of Saturday's programme. ""Little girl Elim is not staying in the dressing room,"" she told BBC Two before the performance. ""She's coming on the stage with me, and I'll give her a little pat on the back."" End of an era for Alison Balsom Alison Balsom ended her professional career after 40 years playing the trumpet British trumpeter Alison Balsom also looked back to her youth, as she gave her retirement performance at the age of 46. She bowed out of her professional career with Hummel's Trumpet Concerto in E flat major, which she first heard at the Barbican as a young girl. It was an emotional performance, with Balsom producing a beautifully rounded tone during the slower, languorous movements before switching into high gear for the dazzling pyrotechnics of the closing Rondo. ""It feels like a wonderful finale to be able to play this piece I've lived with all my musical life,"" she said. ""I can't say how lucky I am to have had music in my life, because it's enriched me as a human being."" As she ended her performance, Balsom was showered with roses from an appreciative audience. Louise Alder adopted the character of Eliza Doolittle for her medley of songs from My Fair Lady Alder was the night's star soprano, promising ""an uplifting evening"" as an antidote to global political turmoil. She transported audiences to Edwardian London with a cheeky medley of songs from My Fair Lady, and scaled the heights with her rendition of Vilja Song – the nostalgic showpiece of Franz Lehár's operetta The Merry Widow. ""I admire any soprano who has a huge voice but can do internalised, soft singing like that,"" observed BBC Radio 3's Georgia Mann. ""That is the mark of true class."" The singer embraced the Last Night's party atmosphere, adopting a cockney accent and flower-sellers costume for Wouldn't It Be Loverly, and sporting a spectacular union flag ballgown for Rule, Britannia! The concert ended with the traditional programme of sea shanties and patriotic songs like Jerusalem and Land of Hope and Glory - as the audience waved flags, set off party poppers and waved stuffed toys. Bill Bailey reappeared at the end of the concert, playing Auld Lang Syne on the Royal Albert Hall's famous ""voice of Jupiter"" organ - but not before bashing out an impromptu version of Europe's rock classic The Final Countdown. It gave the season a suitably celebratory and idiosyncratic climax. This year's season has totalled 86 concerts featuring everyone from jazz singer Samara Joy to the world's only one-handed pianist, Nicholas McCarthy. Highlights included the Vienna Philharmonic's superlative performance of Bruckner's Symphony No 9, and star conductor Klaus Mäkelä, who delivered an astonishingly emotional version of Gustav Mahler's Fifth Symphony with the Netherlands' Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. There was also a Prom dedicated to the music of The Traitors; another featuring the music of Psycho composer Bernard Herrmann; and crossover concert with pop star Jade Thirlwall and guitar virtuoso St Vincent. Almost 290,000 tickets were sold across the season and and millions more tuned into coverage across BBC Radio 3, BBC Sounds and BBC Television. The festival will return on 17 July 2026, for its 131st season.

Sir Brian May and Roger Taylor joined the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus for the momentous occasion.

Sir Brian May emotionally reflected on the late Freddie Mercury, stating he ""would have loved to be here"" and would have been ""so proud,"" imagining the flamboyant star on stage in a formal suit rather than his more unconventional attire. While Sir Brian delivered his iconic guitar solo, tenor Sam Oladeinde impressively filled Mercury's vocal shoes. Despite admitting to missing a cue and feeling ""a little too emotional,"" Sir Brian described the overall experience as ""very special"" and ""great,"" praising Stuart Morley's new orchestral arrangement for its ""fresh grandeur."" The performance culminated with a ghostly recording of Mercury's voice and Roger Taylor striking Britain's largest gong, met with a massive roar.

The evening also featured comedian Bill Bailey, who performed Leroy Anderson's ""The Typewriter"" on a typewriter, dedicating the quirky highlight to his late mother. Debut conductor Elim Chan, inspired by Walt Disney's *Fantasia*, confidently led the concert with themes of childhood, including ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice.""

The premise is that Roman (Dylan O'Brien) has an identical twin who dies in a car crash. Roman goes to a twin bereavement support group, where he meets Dennis (the film's writer-director, James Sweeney), and the two become close friends. But ""the initial premise is merely a small fraction of what this film has in store as it upends expectations and runs with them as far as it can"", said Chase Hutchinson in The Wrap.

It's the twisted story of a rising American football star, Cameron Cade (Tyriq Withers), who needs some extra help to fulfil his potential. His hero is Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans), a legendary quarterback, so Cade is thrilled to be invited to White's isolated training compound. Once he's there, though, he discovers that the training involves gory violence and hallucinatory weirdness. But if that's what it takes to be a sporting superstar, could the ordeal be worth it?

Recent film releases include the acclaimed comedy-drama *Twinless*, the new sports-horror film *Him*, and an in-depth documentary on Leni Riefenstahl.

*Twinless*, showered with rave reviews at the Sundance Film Festival, is an ingenious and outrageous comedy-drama based on a true story. It follows Roman (Dylan O'Brien) as he navigates the death of his identical twin, eventually befriending Dennis (writer-director James Sweeney) at a bereavement support group. Critics praise its remarkable, expectation-defying twists and a ""juggling act of tones"" that is funny, chaotic, dark, and poignant. The film is currently available on Blu-ray and DVD.

Justin Tipping's *Him*, a ""mash-up where sports meet horror,"" was released on September 5th in the US and Canada. The film centers on rising American football star Cameron Cade (Tyriq Withers) who seeks mentorship from legendary quarterback Isaiah White (Marlon Wayans) at an isolated training compound. The intense training, however, involves gory violence and hallucinatory weirdness, with the director stating it ""does not play it safe"" and ""is not for the faint of heart.""

Finally, Andres Veiel's documentary, released September 19th in the US/Canada and September 25th in Australia, offers an ""extraordinary deep-dive"" into the life of Leni Riefenstahl, director of Nazi propaganda films like *Triumph of the Will*. The film challenges Riefenstahl's lifelong claims of artistic focus and ignorance of Hitler's crimes, arguing, with unprecedented archival access, that she remained a Nazi throughout her life.","यहाँ उस अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

**हालिया फ़िल्म रिलीज़: कॉमेडी-ड्रामा 'Twinless', स्पोर्ट्स-हॉरर 'Him' और लेनी रीफेनस्टाल पर डॉक्यूमेंट्री**

हालिया फ़िल्म रिलीज़ में समीक्षकों द्वारा प्रशंसित कॉमेडी-ड्रामा *Twinless*, नई स्पोर्ट्स-हॉरर फ़िल्म *Him*, और लेनी रीफेनस्टाल पर एक गहन डॉक्यूमेंट्री शामिल हैं।

सनडांस फ़िल्म फ़ेस्टिवल में ज़बरदस्त समीक्षाएँ बटोरने वाली *Twinless* एक सच्ची कहानी पर आधारित एक कल्पनाशील और असाधारण कॉमेडी-ड्रामा है। यह रोमन (डायलन ओ'ब्रायन) का अनुसरण करती है, जो अपने हमशक्ल जुड़वाँ भाई की मृत्यु से जूझ रहा है और अंततः एक शोक सहायता समूह में डेनिस (लेखक-निर्देशक जेम्स स्वीनी) से दोस्ती करता है। समीक्षक इसके उल्लेखनीय, उम्मीदों से परे मोड़ों और ""लहज़ों के एक संतुलन"" की प्रशंसा करते हैं, जो हास्यपूर्ण, अराजक, गहरा और मार्मिक है। फ़िल्म वर्तमान में ब्लू-रे और डीवीडी पर उपलब्ध है।

जस्टिन टिपिंग की फ़िल्म *Him*, जिसे 'स्पोर्ट्स और हॉरर का मिश्रण' बताया गया है, 5 सितंबर को अमेरिका और कनाडा में रिलीज़ हुई। यह फ़िल्म उभरते अमेरिकी फ़ुटबॉल स्टार कैमरन केड (टायरिक विथर्स) पर केंद्रित है, जो एक अलग-थलग प्रशिक्षण परिसर में दिग्गज क्वार्टरबैक ईसाया व्हाइट (मार्लन वेन्स) से मार्गदर्शन चाहता है। हालाँकि, इस गहन प्रशिक्षण में भीषण हिंसा और मतिभ्रम वाली विचित्रता शामिल है, और निर्देशक ने कहा है कि यह 'सुरक्षित दांव नहीं है' और 'कमज़ोर दिल वालों के लिए नहीं है'।

अंत में, एंड्रेस वील की डॉक्यूमेंट्री, जो 19 सितंबर को अमेरिका/कनाडा और 25 सितंबर को ऑस्ट्रेलिया में रिलीज़ हुई, नाज़ी प्रचार फ़िल्मों जैसे *Triumph of the Will* की निर्देशक लेनी रीफेनस्टाल के जीवन में एक 'असाधारण रूप से गहन पड़ताल' प्रस्तुत करती है। यह फ़िल्म रीफेनस्टाल के कलात्मकता पर ध्यान केंद्रित करने और हिटलर के अपराधों से अनभिज्ञता के आजीवन दावों को चुनौती देती है। अभूतपूर्व पुरालेखीय पहुँच के साथ, यह तर्क दिया गया है कि वह अपने पूरे जीवन एक नाज़ी बनी रही।",en,[],,"Here are the films to see this month, including Leonardo DiCaprio's new comedy-action-thriller, a sequel to classic music mockumentary Spinal Tap and the last ever Downton Abbey.",[''],www.bbc.com/culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The problem is, however, that once you have joined in this interpretation game, you feel entitled to question and disbelieve even the top line of the narrative –especially in the matter of Darcy. We are told he is ""clever"", but there is no sign of it: his speeches have little wit and few of his actions show any understanding of other people. The key to him is provided by Bingley, a simple fellow, but one who has known Darcy well for a long time. Bingley seems to suggest that his friend is the victim of a morbid melancholy: ""I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do."" But Darcy seldom has anything to do. He sportingly suggests Elizabeth's uncle go fishing on his estate at Pemberley, but never picks up a rod himself. It sometimes feels as though we are in a dangerous guessing game with a superior intelligence – and one who, as the storyteller, holds all the cards A good deal of Darcy's behaviour becomes more explicable if we view him as suffering from a kind of clinical depression. He cannot rouse himself to be polite at Netherfield or Rosings or Longbourn: his melancholy silence is the only common factor in these very different houses. As his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam – a sort of Darcy with manners – tells Elizabeth: ""It is because he will not give himself the trouble."" Think of the way he comes and sits in silence at the Bennets' house when Bingley is renewing his courtship of Jane; or the self-hatred he reveals when Elizabeth is at last his fiancée, talking of the faults of his past that must be confronted: ""Painful recollections will intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled."" Alamy Colin Firth created an iconic version of the moody character in the BBC's classic 1995 TV series (Credit: Alamy) When he does rouse himself to action he is unable to take responsibility for the consequences. He points out to Bingley how vulgar the Bennets are and claims, wrongly, that Jane does not reciprocate Bingley's strong feelings. Darcy persuades Bingley not to return to his house in Hertfordshire and conceals from him the fact that Jane is in London, where Bingley could meet her. Of this deception he later tells Elizabeth that he ""condescended to adopt the measures of art"" (lied, in other words) and that ""Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me… I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer."" That a man can consider his own behaviour to be both ""beneath"" him and not worth apologising for makes one worry for his state of mind. But the truth is that Darcy badly needs to keep Bingley on hand to supply the energy he himself lacks; he cannot risk losing Bingley to Jane or he will also have to marry someone ""beneath"" him – Elizabeth – to secure the anti-depressant vitality he needs.","A recent analysis proposes a re-interpretation of Mr. Darcy from Jane Austen's *Pride and Prejudice*, suggesting his often contradictory and impolite behavior stems not from inherent cleverness but from a ""morbid melancholy"" or clinical depression. Despite descriptions of him as ""clever,"" Darcy consistently demonstrates little wit or understanding.

His close friend Bingley describes Darcy as an ""aweful object"" on particular occasions, hinting at his underlying condition. Evidence for this view includes Darcy's pervasive idleness, his mother's observation that he's ""always looking for something to do,"" and his consistent melancholy silence in various social settings where he fails to be polite. His cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, attributes this to Darcy ""not giv[ing] himself the trouble.""

The analysis also recontextualizes Darcy's manipulative actions, such as deliberately misrepresenting Jane Bennet's feelings to Bingley and persuading him to leave Hertfordshire. Darcy later admits to these ""measures of art"" (lying) but simultaneously considers such deception ""beneath"" him without offering a true apology, highlighting a concerning inability to take responsibility and a troubled state of mind. This behavior, including his need to keep Bingley close, is explained as a desperate attempt to compensate for his own lack of energy and avoid marrying someone ""beneath"" him if Bingley were to do so. This re-evaluation offers a new lens through which to view the iconic character, famously portrayed by Colin Firth.","यहां अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

**मिस्टर डार्सी की नई व्याख्या: क्या उनका अशिष्ट व्यवहार 'नैदानिक अवसाद' का परिणाम था?**

हालिया विश्लेषण जेन ऑस्टिन के उपन्यास *प्राइड एंड प्रेजुडिस* के मिस्टर डार्सी की एक नई व्याख्या प्रस्तुत करता है, जिसमें सुझाव दिया गया है कि उनका अक्सर विरोधाभासी और अशिष्ट व्यवहार अंतर्निहित बुद्धिमत्ता के बजाय ""गहरे अवसाद"" (morbid melancholy) या नैदानिक ​​अवसाद से उत्पन्न होता है। उन्हें ""चतुर"" बताए जाने के बावजूद, डार्सी लगातार बहुत कम हाजिरजवाबी या समझदारी प्रदर्शित करते हैं।

उनके करीबी दोस्त बिंगले कुछ खास मौकों पर डार्सी को एक ""भयानक वस्तु"" (aweful object) बताते हैं, जो उनकी अंतर्निहित स्थिति का संकेत देता है। इस विचार के प्रमाणों में डार्सी का सर्वव्यापी आलस्य, उनकी माँ की यह टिप्पणी कि वह ""हमेशा कुछ करने की तलाश में रहते हैं"", और विभिन्न सामाजिक परिवेशों में उनकी लगातार उदास चुप्पी शामिल है जहाँ वह विनम्र रहने में विफल रहते हैं। उनके चचेरे भाई, कर्नल फिट्ज़विलियम, इसे डार्सी के ""खुद को परेशान न करने"" (not giv[ing] himself the trouble) के रवैये का परिणाम बताते हैं।

यह विश्लेषण डार्सी की जोड़-तोड़ वाली कार्रवाइयों को भी नए संदर्भ में देखता है, जैसे जेन बेनेट की भावनाओं को बिंगले के सामने जानबूझकर गलत तरीके से प्रस्तुत करना और उसे हर्टफोर्डशायर छोड़ने के लिए मनाना। डार्सी बाद में इन ""कला के उपायों"" (झूठ) को स्वीकार करते हैं, लेकिन साथ ही ऐसे धोखे को अपने ""स्तर से नीचे"" मानते हैं, बिना कोई सच्ची माफी मांगे। यह जिम्मेदारी लेने में उनकी चिंताजनक अक्षमता और एक अशांत मनःस्थिति को उजागर करता है। इस व्यवहार को, जिसमें बिंगले को अपने करीब रखने की उनकी आवश्यकता भी शामिल है, उनकी अपनी ऊर्जा की कमी की भरपाई करने और यदि बिंगले ऐसा करता है तो खुद को किसी ""कमतर"" व्यक्ति से शादी करने से बचाने के एक हताश प्रयास के रूप में समझाया गया है। यह पुनर्मूल्यांकन इस प्रतिष्ठित चरित्र को देखने के लिए एक नया दृष्टिकोण प्रदान करता है, जिसे कॉलिन फ़र्थ ने प्रसिद्ध रूप से चित्रित किया था।",en,[],,"Mostly miserable and even ""unforgivably cruel"", Jane Austen's famous romantic hero is not what he seems, writes the author Sebastian Faulks, in an exclusive extract.",[''],www.bbc.com/culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""We started jump-cutting shots to give the jagged feeling of what's going on in his brain. Marty, of course, had thought out very carefully all the framing and camera moves on the shots. There is not much improvisation there, but he had very clear ideas how to give the paranoid feeling."" The music Scorsese used was key. He set himself a rule that the songs for each scene must have been possible to hear at the time the action is set, helping to locate the audience in a particular time and place. ""Marty had certain music that he knew he was going to use,"" Schoonmaker told the BBC. Scorsese had composed the shots in his head to particular songs before he started filming. He would often play music on set so he could synchronise the scene perfectly to the musical beats. ""The sequences where De Niro is knocking off everybody who has participated in the heist with him, he shot with [Eric Clapton's Derek and the Dominos song] Layla playing on the set over a speaker so that he could get the camera moves exactly to fit the bars of music he intended."" More like this: • The only X-rated winner of the Oscar for best picture • How The Godfather was a stark warning for the US • How Easy Rider revolutionised Hollywood The songs often serve to reflect a character's state of mind in a scene. As the film opens, Tony Bennett's Rags to Riches is heard as Hill begins to tell the shaggy dog story of his life of crime; Then He Kissed Me by The Crystals plays over the long tracking shot of Hill's big date with Karen at the Copacabana, emphasising their youthful romance; while The Rolling Stones' Gimme Shelter soundtracks Hill's desperate cocaine use in the apartment of the woman he is having an affair with. Even as the film ends, with Hill rueing the dull suburban life he is now confined to as part of the witness protection scheme, Sid Vicious' punk cover of Frank Sinatra's My Way hints that Hill doesn't regret his criminal past. The real-life Hill would struggle to adjust to life as an average citizen and ended up getting expelled from the witness protection programme in the early 1990s after being arrested on drugs charges. While Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather films of the 1970s focus on the men at the top of the Mafia power structure, bringing a stately gravitas to the gangster mythology, Goodfellas' frenetic, street-level view of those hustling further down the criminal food chain serves to show how ruthless it is. As the film progresses, the earlier glamour of the criminal lifestyle comes to seem illusory, while its violence seems terrifyingly real. By the end, the majority of its characters are either dead, in prison or unhappy with the life they are living.","A specific Martin Scorsese film (implied to be *Goodfellas* given the detailed descriptions) employed rapid jump-cutting and fast-paced editing, meticulously designed to evoke a jagged, paranoid, and cocaine-induced mental state. Scorsese planned every frame and camera move, leaving little to improvisation, to achieve this distinct visual style and convey a feeling of unease.

Music was central to the film's success and integrated deeply into its production. Scorsese pre-composed shots in his head to particular songs, adhered to a rule that all music must be era-appropriate, and often played tracks on set—such as Eric Clapton's ""Layla"" during action sequences—to perfectly synchronize camera moves and scene beats. Songs powerfully reflected characters' states of mind, from Tony Bennett's ""Rags to Riches"" marking a criminal ascent to Sid Vicious' ""My Way"" hinting at unrepentant regret.

The film offered a frenetic, street-level view of lower-echelon criminal life, contrasting with *The Godfather*'s focus on high-level Mafia power. It progressively stripped away the initial glamour of the criminal world, revealing its terrifying violence and bleak realities. Ultimately, most characters met grim fates—dead, imprisoned, or unhappy—mirroring the real-life struggles of protagonist Henry Hill, who was expelled from witness protection due to drug charges.","मार्टिन स्कॉर्सेसी की एक विशिष्ट फिल्म (विस्तृत विवरणों को देखते हुए, यह *गुडफेलाज़* मानी जा रही है) में तेज़ी से जम्प-कटिंग और द्रुत गति की एडिटिंग का इस्तेमाल किया गया था, जिसे एक अव्यवस्थित, भ्रमित और कोकीन-प्रेरित मानसिक स्थिति को दर्शाने के लिए सावधानीपूर्वक डिज़ाइन किया गया था। स्कॉर्सेसी ने इस विशिष्ट दृश्य शैली को प्राप्त करने और बेचैनी की भावना व्यक्त करने के लिए हर फ्रेम और कैमरा मूवमेंट की योजना बनाई थी, जिसमें तात्कालिकता (improvisation) की बहुत कम गुंजाइश छोड़ी गई थी।

फिल्म की सफलता में संगीत केंद्रीय था और इसे इसके निर्माण में गहराई से एकीकृत किया गया था। स्कॉर्सेसी ने विशिष्ट गानों के अनुरूप अपने दिमाग में ही दृश्यों की कल्पना की थी। उन्होंने इस नियम का पालन किया कि सभी संगीत उस युग के अनुसार (era-appropriate) होने चाहिए। अक्सर, वे कैमरा मूवमेंट और दृश्य की ताल को पूरी तरह से समकालिक करने के लिए सेट पर गाने बजाते थे, जैसे कि एक्शन दृश्यों के दौरान एरिक क्लैप्टन का ""लैला""। गाने पात्रों की मानसिक स्थिति को सशक्त रूप से दर्शाते थे – टोनी बेनेट का ""रैग्स टू रिचेस"" एक आपराधिक उत्थान को चिह्नित करता था, तो सिड विसियस का ""माई वे"" बेखौफ पछतावे की ओर संकेत करता था।

यह फिल्म निचले स्तर के आपराधिक जीवन का एक उन्मत्त, जमीनी-स्तर का नज़रिया प्रस्तुत करती थी, जो *द गॉडफादर* के उच्च-स्तरीय माफिया शक्ति पर ध्यान केंद्रित करने के विपरीत था। फिल्म धीरे-धीरे आपराधिक दुनिया की शुरुआती चकाचौंध को हटाती गई, और इसकी भयानक हिंसा तथा निराशाजनक वास्तविकताओं को उजागर करती थी। अंततः, अधिकांश पात्रों का अंत भयावह हुआ – वे मर गए, कैद हुए, या दुखी रहे – यह नायक हेनरी हिल के वास्तविक जीवन के संघर्षों को दर्शाता है, जिसे ड्रग के आरोपों के कारण गवाह सुरक्षा से बाहर कर दिया गया था।",en,[],,"Martin Scorsese's crime epic was released 35 years ago.

No, I'm not talking about Banksy's recent (and rapidly erased) mural, which the street artist sprayed onto the side of the Royal Courts of Justice in London on 7 September. Banksy's work, which satirically depicted an English judge in traditional wig and gown, pummelling a prone protester with his gavel as splatters of blood became the very message emblazoned on the blank placard that the protester carried, was partially eradicated by authorities three days later.

If Banksy's controversial work calls to mind such potent precedents from the history of art, so too does his mural's fate.

Their hits featured in the soundtrack to school discos, people would flick through magazines for posters and debate who their favourite member was. After notching up three number one singles, three number one albums and two Brit awards, the band struggled to find the same charts success again and were dropped by their record label. In a year when nostalgia for their golden era is driving comebacks and bands including Five, Pulp and Oasis are back on the road, Blue members Simon Webbe, Duncan James, Antony Costa and Lee Ryan are preparing for one of their own. Their upcoming tour marks 25 years since the band first got together - so a quarter of a century later, what's changed? ""My body every morning – it's like Rice Krispies,"" moans Manchester-born Simon Webb. ""It's snap, crackle and pop when I get out of bed."" It's a very different picture from their early music videos, with the band performing synchronised dance moves in dark rooms under bright lights, or striding through the streets in tank tops preaching the virtues of One Love. Blue have been reflecting on how attitudes have changed as they prepare to head back on the road The singers agree growing up means priorities have changed. They are touring, says London's Antony Costa, not only because they love it, but also because ""we've got to work to provide for our families and put food on the table"". ""We have a different mindset now from when we were doing it last time because we were just kids,"" says Duncan James. All four members are dads now. ""My daughter's 20, she lives in Germany - she's a ballerina,"" says the Wiltshire-born singer. ""My responsibilities are looking after her and, of course, my mum."" 'Love letter' For Duncan, their new single One Last Time and its themes of grief and being there for loved ones in hard times are personal. ""My best mate Terry, he was a dancer on our first ever tour back in the day 25 years ago,"" Duncan says. ""We just became best mates and I lost him very tragically and sadly last year and I was gutted. But I wrote this song in his memory and it was almost like a bit of a love letter to him."" Terry John, a model, dancer and choreographer, has been previously described by Duncan as the most loving, giving and caring person he knew. Meanwhile, he says Simon's wife broke down in tears when she heard the song. ""It's not easy to talk about but we lost her dad about a year or so ago suddenly as well and it's just the shock factor of that,"" says Simon. ""This song is one of those songs that takes you back to that one special person – or those special people in your lives that have passed on or those who you might not have seen for a long time and are hoping to do so."" The band have all experienced grief, but didn't want to make One Last Time a sad song. ""We wanted to put an uplifting beat on it,"" Duncan says as they speak about how positivity has helped them through difficult times. 'No luxury of talking' Writing previously in The Radio Times, Blue's former manager Daniel Glatman said if he was managing boybands now he would hire 24/7 therapists. ""We didn't have that luxury of talking at the time,"" Antony explains. ""It was just literally in and out and it was just graft, graft, graft. So it's nice that we can sit down and take a step back and if we want to talk, we can."" ""We've got each other now,"" Simon says. ""I've had a few dark shadows linger over me and Duncan's always been there and so has Antony and so has Lee."" Getty Images Simon says Duncan and the other band members have been there for him at difficult times Listening to them chat, the conversation flows easily. They go from emotional talk to banter, taking the mick out of each other and themselves. ""I think they all decide on who's going to talk to me next,"" Simon laughs. ""Who's going to say something to Simon? They spin the bottle in that aspect. ""But we do have that with each other anyway – there's always the light at the end of the tunnel."" ""Mental health back then wasn't a thing,"" says Duncan. ""It wasn't something that anybody talked about."" Now they speak about the benefits of having the discipline to keep talking to others, whether a therapist, colleague or friend. ""Talking about your problems is really important – don't ever filter feelings,"" says Duncan. ""Don't sit there on your own thinking you've got no-one to talk to."" He says at different times in their careers, each of the band members had found talking ""a real saving grace"".","Pop group Blue is making a comeback with a 25th-anniversary tour, driven by both nostalgia and the financial responsibilities of being fathers. The band members—Simon Webbe, Duncan James, Antony Costa, and Lee Ryan—note significant personal changes, including increased family duties and the physical toll of aging, a stark contrast to their early careers when they were ""just kids.""

Their new single, ""One Last Time,"" delves into themes of grief and support for loved ones. This is deeply personal for Duncan James, who wrote the song in memory of his best friend and former tour dancer, Terry John, who tragically passed away last year. Simon Webbe also connected to the song after his wife's father's sudden death. Despite these sad origins, the band aimed for an uplifting beat and positive message.

A major reflection point for Blue is the profound shift in attitudes towards mental health. They recall a time when ""mental health wasn't a thing"" and they lacked ""the luxury of talking"" while relentlessly working. Their former manager even stated he'd now hire 24/7 therapists for boybands. Today, the band emphasizes the crucial importance of open communication, whether with therapists, friends, or each other, calling it a ""saving grace."" They highlight the strong support system within the band, having helped each other through ""dark shadows"" and underscoring their evolution into adults advocating for well-being.","पॉप ग्रुप ब्लू अपनी 25वीं वर्षगांठ के दौरे के साथ वापसी कर रहा है, जिसकी प्रेरणा उन्हें पुरानी यादों को ताज़ा करने की इच्छा और पिता होने की आर्थिक ज़िम्मेदारियों दोनों से मिली है। बैंड के सदस्य—साइमन वेब, डंकन जेम्स, एंटनी कोस्टा और ली रयान—बताते हैं कि उनके व्यक्तिगत जीवन में महत्वपूर्ण बदलाव आए हैं, जिनमें बढ़ी हुई पारिवारिक ज़िम्मेदारियाँ और बढ़ती उम्र का शारीरिक प्रभाव शामिल है। यह उनके शुरुआती करियर के बिलकुल विपरीत है, जब वे 'सिर्फ बच्चे' थे।

उनका नया सिंगल, 'वन लास्ट टाइम', प्रियजनों के लिए दुख और समर्थन के विषयों पर आधारित है। यह डंकन जेम्स के लिए बेहद व्यक्तिगत है, जिन्होंने यह गीत अपने सबसे अच्छे दोस्त और पूर्व टूर डांसर, टेरी जॉन की याद में लिखा था, जिनका पिछले साल दुखद निधन हो गया था। साइमन वेब भी अपनी पत्नी के पिता के अचानक निधन के बाद इस गीत से भावनात्मक रूप से जुड़े। इन दुखद मूलों के बावजूद, बैंड ने एक उत्साहवर्धक धुन और सकारात्मक संदेश देने का लक्ष्य रखा।

ब्लू के लिए एक प्रमुख विचार बिंदु मानसिक स्वास्थ्य के प्रति दृष्टिकोण में आया गहरा बदलाव है। वे उस समय को याद करते हैं जब 'मानसिक स्वास्थ्य जैसी कोई बात नहीं थी' और लगातार काम करते हुए उनके पास 'खुले तौर पर बात करने की सुविधा' नहीं थी। उनके पूर्व प्रबंधक ने तो यहाँ तक कहा कि अब वह बॉयबैंड्स के लिए 24/7 थेरेपिस्ट रखेंगे। आज, बैंड खुले संचार के महत्वपूर्ण महत्व पर जोर देता है, चाहे थेरेपिस्ट, दोस्तों या एक-दूसरे के साथ, इसे 'सबसे बड़ा सहारा' बताते हुए। वे बैंड के भीतर मजबूत समर्थन प्रणाली को उजागर करते हैं, जिसमें उन्होंने एक-दूसरे को 'अंधेरे सायों' (मुश्किल समय) से निकलने में मदद की है और यह दर्शाता है कि वे अब ऐसे वयस्क बन गए हैं जो मानसिक भलाई की वकालत करते हैं।",en,[],,Noughties boy band Blue say there was no discussion about their wellbeing when they started out.,[''],www.bbc.com/culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You feel like you have to do it 2 hours ago Share Save Noor Nanji Culture reporter Share Save £100 or £1,000: How much would you spend on a hen or stag do? ""Hey ladies, it's that time again. Please transfer £300 by 7pm tonight for accommodation, matching outfits, and surprise gifts for the bride :)"" It's the message lots of us in our 20s and 30s are used to getting. That includes Hayley, 29, who says she spent more than £1,000 attending a hen party in Marbella, Spain. ""In the WhatsApp groups, it's always initially the flights and the hotel,"" Hayley says, ""and then afterwards it's like, 'OK, we're going to this beach club, we're getting that T-shirt, we're going to do that cocktail club'. ""You feel like you have to do it."" Hen and stag dos, like weddings and baby showers, are a chance to celebrate big milestones in our friends' lives. But what was once a night down the pub has, for many, become an entire weekend away. And for some, the costs are too much. ""Don't mind me, just choosing whether to attend or pay my rent for the next three months *crying face emoji*,"" wrote one TikTok user, in a video about expensive hen parties. Twenty-nine-year-old Lucy, told me the rising price of friendship feels like it's spiralling out of control. ""It's that time of life where everyone is getting engaged, married or having kids,"" Lucy says. ""And the costs of celebrating all of that adds up."" ""Money doesn't grow on trees,"" adds Charles, who's 27. ""Lots of my friends work in the public sector, and it's a struggle to keep up.” So what are the pitfalls when organising a hen, a stag, or even a wedding? And is there a way to keep everyone happy? 'You can't say no' Getty Images One common theme is that people feel pressured into saying ""yes"" to attending to avoid upsetting friends, or worse, looking cheap. ""I see TikToks all the time, saying: 'Just say no, it's so simple,'"" says Anna, who asked the BBC not to use her real name. ""But it causes so much falling out, it's ridiculous."" The 29-year-old says her cousin chose to hold her hen party in Spain, at a cost of about £300 per person for flights and accommodation, before factoring in spending money. Anna says she told her cousin she couldn't afford it, but was then hit with passive aggressive messages. ""[She said] 'Just save £20 a month for the next year,'"" Anna says. ""But I didn't have that. Then she said, 'Ask your dad'."" Begrudgingly, Anna agreed to go - but the hen was then cancelled due to Covid. She's since been invited to a number of other hen parties and weddings. She feels she can't justify the costs - but doesn't want to be labelled as the friend who can't afford it. ""I could imagine the comments behind [my] back,"" Anna says. ‘It’s £100 here, £100 there' Then there are the costs when you actually get to said hen, stag or wedding. My best friend Claire got married recently and as a lifelong raver, had decided to hold her hen party in Ibiza. As her bridesmaids, we tried to keep costs down. Hotels were prohibitively expensive, so we opted for a hostel instead. It looked decent online, but turned out to be not dissimilar to a prison cell. With flights, accommodation and spending in bars and clubs, the whole trip set us back about £1,000 each. Still, according to research, we did comparatively well. Jasmine, left, is getting married and her friends, Hayley and Lily, and sister Ruby, are planning her hen party According to a study from Aviva in 2023, stag and hen invitees spent an average of £779 per person in the UK, and £1,208 abroad. The average price abroad was £1,664 this year, according to a separate study by the insurer. For Jasmine, who's 28, it's the unexpected costs that are the worst. She's been to hen parties where there's been a set price, but then additional payments of up to £100 per person were asked for. ""And you've already committed and you don't want to pull out,"" she says. Jasmine, who's engaged to be married, thinks an appropriate amount to spend should be in the region of £100-200, ""as you'd spend that on a day or night out anyway"". To split... or not to split? Getty Images Then there's the thorny question of splitting bills. Another woman, who we're calling Jemima, says on a recent hen weekend, she had to contribute to a central kitty for bars - even though she doesn't drink. ""It made no sense, but you have to go along with the flow,"" the 34-year-old says. ""The bills kept racking up and up."" This is not just a British problem, either. TikTok creator, Sydney Jo from New York, recently told me as she and her friends approach their 30s, bachelorettes and weddings have become a major source of drama. And that's provided excellent content for her viral series about a girls’ group chat. In a recent episode, set during a bachelorette trip to Costa Rica, one of the characters declares that her friend is ""driving her insane"". ""The money stuff?"" her friend guesses. ""Yes, THANK YOU,"" the 27-year-old replies. ""It's like, refusing to order Ubers, being so annoying about the cheque at every single meal... Seriously? I'm going to lose it."" That's before you even get to the wedding Once you're done with the hen and stag do, then you have to factor in the cost of going to the big day itself. Lucy went to a friend's wedding in Switzerland last year which she says cost her about £700. It was in a ""really random town"", she says, which involved taking a train and a bus, and accommodation options were very limited which meant she had to stay in an expensive hotel, driving up costs. Food was covered, but everyone had to pay for their own drinks. ""It was a lovely day,"" Lucy says. ""But very expensive."" The couple are now getting divorced. ""So that was a waste of money,"" she adds. Elle Elle got married abroad, but now regrets that Elle got married in Cyprus when she was in her early 30s. She's also now divorced, and says, on reflection, it wasn't worth it. Family and friends had flown out, and in the lead up to the wedding activities like paragliding and boat days had been booked, so the costs had really added up. ""Looking back, I wouldn't have done a destination wedding. I know how much pressure it put people under,"" Elle says. ""One of my bridesmaids was upset as she couldn't afford it and for a while she was too scared to tell me. Eventually she did, and I felt really bad."" Hen and stag dos and don'ts Getty Images","Celebratory events such as hen and stag parties, along with destination weddings, have become a significant financial and social burden for attendees, shifting from simple gatherings to costly multi-day, often international, extravaganzas. Individuals frequently report spending upwards of £1,000 for a single event, with UK averages at £779 and international trips costing £1,208 to £1,664 per person, often compounded by unexpected additional payments.

This escalating cost is accompanied by immense social pressure, particularly among those in their 20s and 30s, who feel compelled to participate to avoid upsetting friends or being perceived as cheap. This ""can't say no"" mentality leads to significant financial strain, with some struggling to prioritize event attendance over essential living expenses like rent. The situation frequently causes emotional drama, from passive-aggressive messages for declining invitations to disputes over bill splitting (even for non-drinkers), and feelings of guilt or regret.

The problem is not unique to the UK, with similar issues sparking conflict in friend groups and viral content in the US. The financial and emotional toll extends to destination weddings, where even brides acknowledge the pressure placed on guests. Some attendees, like those who spent hundreds on a wedding for a couple who later divorced, view the expenses as a ""waste of money."" Ultimately, these milestones, intended for celebration, are increasingly overshadowed by overwhelming financial expectations and relational stress, highlighting a concerning ""rising price of friendship.""","यहां अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद दिया गया है:

बैचलर पार्टियों (हेन और स्टैग पार्टी) और डेस्टिनेशन वेडिंग्स जैसे उत्सव संबंधी आयोजन, अब मेहमानों के लिए एक महत्वपूर्ण वित्तीय और सामाजिक बोझ बन गए हैं। साधारण मिलन समारोहों से बढ़कर, ये खर्चीले, कई दिनों तक चलने वाले और अक्सर अंतर्राष्ट्रीय स्तर के भव्य आयोजनों में बदल गए हैं। लोग अक्सर एक ही आयोजन पर £1,000 से अधिक खर्च करने की बात कहते हैं, जबकि यूके में औसत खर्च £779 है। अंतर्राष्ट्रीय यात्राओं पर प्रति व्यक्ति £1,208 से £1,664 का खर्च आता है, जो अक्सर अप्रत्याशित अतिरिक्त भुगतानों से और भी बढ़ जाता है।

इस बढ़ती लागत के साथ भारी सामाजिक दबाव भी जुड़ा है, खासकर 20 और 30 के दशक के लोगों में। वे दोस्तों को नाराज़ करने या कंजूस समझे जाने से बचने के लिए इनमें शामिल होने को मजबूर महसूस करते हैं। यह ""ना नहीं कह पाने"" की मानसिकता महत्वपूर्ण वित्तीय तनाव पैदा करती है, जहाँ कुछ लोग किराए जैसे आवश्यक जीवन-यापन के खर्चों की तुलना में इन आयोजनों में शामिल होने को प्राथमिकता देने में संघर्ष करते हैं। यह स्थिति अक्सर भावनात्मक मनमुटाव का कारण बनती है – निमंत्रण अस्वीकार करने पर निष्क्रिय-आक्रामक संदेशों से लेकर बिल बांटने को लेकर झगड़ों तक (यहाँ तक कि शराब न पीने वालों के लिए भी), और अपराधबोध या पछतावे की भावनाएँ भी आती हैं।

यह समस्या केवल यूके तक ही सीमित नहीं है; अमेरिका में भी इसी तरह के मुद्दे मित्र-समूहों में कलह और वायरल सामग्री को जन्म दे रहे हैं। इसका वित्तीय और भावनात्मक प्रभाव डेस्टिनेशन वेडिंग्स तक भी फैला हुआ है, जहाँ दुल्हनें भी मेहमानों पर पड़ने वाले दबाव को स्वीकार करती हैं। कुछ मेहमान, जैसे कि वे जिन्होंने एक ऐसे जोड़े की शादी पर सैकड़ों खर्च किए जो बाद में तलाक ले चुके थे, इन खर्चों को ""पैसे की बर्बादी"" मानते हैं। अंततः, जश्न मनाने के उद्देश्य से रखे गए ये महत्वपूर्ण आयोजन, भारी वित्तीय अपेक्षाओं और संबंधों में तनाव से लगातार धूमिल हो रहे हैं, जो ""दोस्ती की बढ़ती कीमत"" नामक एक चिंताजनक सच्चाई को उजागर करते हैं।",en,[],,"What was once a night down the pub has become an entire weekend away.

Powell has said that viewers knowing it was Manning in disguise all along was a key inspiration in making the series, which he created with Michael Waldron (Loki). He describes their thinking as, ""Let's use the lie at the centre of this thing, which creates inherent fun conflict."" Or, as he put it: ""We're going to Tootsie this thing. Let's Mrs. Doubtfire it."" It looks like they Ted Lasso'd it too. That warm-hearted sports comedy was based on an even less likely source, a character in a television promo.

Two new series are set to debut in late September, offering a mix of high-stakes thriller and warm-hearted sports comedy.

**The Savant (Jessica Chastain)**
Jessica Chastain stars as Jodie in ""The Savant,"" a timely thriller premiering September 26 internationally on Apple TV+. Jodie's intuitive skills make her excellent at her top-secret job of infiltrating online hate groups using a false persona. However, her work becomes more immediate, straining her home life with two children and a military husband as she tracks a terror group she's certain is planning a major attack. A surreal element sees Jeremy Bobb playing Jodie's online persona. Created by Melissa James Gibson (""The Americans""), the ambitious series is based on a real person profiled in a 2019 Cosmopolitan article about preventing mass shootings.

**Chad Powers (Glen Powell)**
Also arriving is the warm-hearted sports comedy ""Chad Powers,"" starring Glen Powell, premiering September 30 on Hulu in the US and Disney+ internationally. Powell plays Russ Holliday, a college football player banned after a viral temper tantrum. Eight years later, he attempts to rejoin the sport by disguising himself with a wig and genial persona as ""Chad Powers"" to try out for a different team. The show is inspired by a real-life stunt from Eli Manning's ESPN series ""Eli's Places,"" where Manning famously pulled a similar disguise. Powell, who co-created the series with Michael Waldron (""Loki""), explained their approach was to ""use the lie at the centre of this thing"" to create ""inherent fun conflict,"" likening it to films like ""Tootsie"" and ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" and the series ""Ted Lasso.""

सितंबर के अंत में दो नई सीरीज़ रिलीज़ होने वाली हैं, जिनमें एक रोमांचक थ्रिलर और एक दिल को छू लेने वाली स्पोर्ट्स कॉमेडी शामिल है।

**द सैवेंट (जेसिका चैस्टेन)**
जेसिका चैस्टेन 'द सैवेंट' में जोडी की भूमिका में हैं, जो 26 सितंबर को एप्पल टीवी+ पर अंतरराष्ट्रीय स्तर पर प्रीमियर होने वाला एक सामयिक थ्रिलर है। जोडी अपनी सहज क्षमताओं का उपयोग करके ऑनलाइन नफरत फैलाने वाले समूहों में एक नकली पहचान के साथ घुसपैठ करने के अपने बेहद गोपनीय काम में माहिर है। हालाँकि, जब वह एक आतंकी समूह का पता लगाती है जिसके बारे में उसे यकीन है कि वह एक बड़े हमले की योजना बना रहा है, तो उसका काम अधिक तत्काल हो जाता है, जिससे उसके दो बच्चों और एक सैन्य पति के साथ उसके घरेलू जीवन में तनाव आ जाता है। दिलचस्प बात यह है कि जेरेमी बॉब जोडी के ऑनलाइन व्यक्तित्व का किरदार निभाते हैं। मेलिसा जेम्स गिब्सन ('द अमेरिकन्स' फेम) द्वारा बनाई गई यह महत्वाकांक्षी सीरीज़ 2019 के कॉस्मोपॉलिटन लेख में जनसंहार (mass shootings) को रोकने के बारे में प्रोफाइल किए गए एक वास्तविक व्यक्ति पर आधारित है।

**चैड पावर्स (ग्लेन पॉवेल)**
इसके अलावा, ग्लेन पॉवेल अभिनीत दिल को छू लेने वाली स्पोर्ट्स कॉमेडी 'चैड पावर्स' भी आ रही है, जिसका प्रीमियर 30 सितंबर को अमेरिका में हुलु (Hulu) और अंतरराष्ट्रीय स्तर पर डिज़्नी+ (Disney+) पर होगा। पॉवेल रस्स हॉलिडे का किरदार निभाते हैं, एक कॉलेज फुटबॉल खिलाड़ी जिसे वायरल हुए गुस्से के प्रदर्शन (temper tantrum) के बाद प्रतिबंधित कर दिया गया था। आठ साल बाद, वह विग और एक सौम्य व्यक्तित्व के साथ खुद को 'चैड पावर्स' के रूप में भेस बदलकर एक अलग टीम के लिए कोशिश करने के लिए खेल में फिर से शामिल होने का प्रयास करता है। यह शो एली मैनिंग की ईएसपीएन सीरीज़ 'एलीज़ प्लेसेज़' के एक वास्तविक जीवन के स्टंट से प्रेरित है, जहाँ मैनिंग ने इसी तरह का भेस बनाया था। पॉवेल, जिन्होंने माइकल वाल्ड्रॉन ('लोकी' फेम) के साथ इस सीरीज़ का सह-निर्माण किया है, ने बताया कि उन्होंने ""इस कहानी के केंद्र में मौजूद झूठ का उपयोग"" करके ""अंतर्निहित मजेदार टकराव"" पैदा करने का लक्ष्य रखा, इसकी तुलना 'टूट्सी' और 'मिसेज डाउटफायर' जैसी फिल्मों और 'टेड लासो' जैसी सीरीज़ से करते हुए।

Can anyone steal a Knives Out film from the great detective Benoit Blanc? As it turns out, yes, almost. The biggest revelation of Wake Up Dead Man, the third in Rian Johnson's series of deliciously entertaining mysteries, is that Josh O'Connor, so great at drama, is also an excellent comic. He plays Father Jud Duplenticy, a former boxer turned priest, who as punishment for a violent outburst is sent from upstate New York to a tiny parish in the village of Chimney Rock. It's a setting that looks as if it has been transported from a screen adaptation of an Agatha Christie novel, with a small neo-Gothic church and adjacent graveyard. It's exactly the kind of place where too many murders take place. But instead of meeting some kindly vicar, Jud goes to work for Monsignor Jefferson Wicks, played by Josh Brolin as a wild-haired, fiery cynic. It's not quite fair to say that O'Connor steals the film from Daniel Craig's Blanc. Craig is a scene-stealer himself With its Gothic atmosphere and deeper themes, Wake Up Dead Man has a darker tone than the previous Knives Out films. Yet it is also the funniest and most playful so far. Along with the usual murder(s) and large glittery cast, it has religion, and a touch of meta in its literary allusions and film references. Johnson has acknowledged wanting to go back to the roots of mystery stories with this instalment, citing Edgar Allan Poe, so it's good to keep in mind Poe's themes of men haunted by guilt and of creepy burials. But with more assurance than ever, he walks a perfectly balanced line as he borrows old tropes and adapts them. There is plenty of irreverent dialogue here, and rude graffiti on a mausoleum. It's not quite fair to say that O'Connor steals the film from Daniel Craig's Blanc. Craig is a scene-stealer himself. Blanc turns up to solve a murder in Chimney Rock with his southern accent and confident swagger, looking more dapper than ever. But it seems that with each Knives Out film he has fewer scenes, and at times he is like an orchestra conductor weaving us through the various characters and possibilities in the ever-twisting plot. Blanc even enlists Jud's help in solving the murder. There's no question that Father Jud is the film's throughline, and O'Connor swerves gracefully from comic to serious. Johnson begins by playing with point of view. We get Jud's account, requested by Blanc, of the events leading to what Jud calls the Good Friday murder. Using a device he acknowledges is borrowed from mystery novels, he introduces Blanc and us to the congregants, most of them with a cultish devotion to Wicks.","""Wake Up Dead Man,"" the third installment in Rian Johnson's *Knives Out* series, is hailed as the franchise's ""darkest"" yet ""most playful"" entry. While Daniel Craig returns as the dapper detective Benoit Blanc, it's Josh O'Connor, showcasing surprising comedic talent as Father Jud Duplenticy (a former boxer turned priest), who is lauded for almost stealing the film.

The mystery unfolds in the atmospheric, neo-Gothic village of Chimney Rock, a setting reminiscent of an Agatha Christie novel, where Jud is assigned to work under the fiery cynic Monsignor Jefferson Wicks (Josh Brolin). Johnson successfully blends a darker tone with deeper themes and a Gothic atmosphere, all while delivering the franchise's funniest and most playful script, rich with irreverent dialogue, literary allusions, and meta-commentary.

Drawing inspiration from the roots of mystery stories and Edgar Allan Poe's themes of guilt, Johnson skillfully adapts classic tropes with confident assurance. While Blanc arrives with his characteristic swagger to solve a murder, his role is more akin to an ""orchestra conductor,"" guiding the narrative and its diverse characters, and he even enlists Jud's help. Jud, portrayed by O'Connor with a graceful balance of comic and serious, becomes the film's central throughline. The narrative creatively employs a point-of-view device, presenting key events, including a ""Good Friday murder,"" from Jud's perspective, thereby introducing the congregants who harbor a cultish devotion to Wicks.","रियान जॉनसन की *नाइव्स आउट* श्रंखला की तीसरी किस्त, ""वेक अप डेड मैन,"" को फ्रेंचाइजी की अब तक की ""सबसे गहरी"" लेकिन ""सबसे चंचल"" एंट्री के रूप में सराहा जा रहा है। जहाँ डैनियल क्रेग डैशिंग जासूस बेनोइट ब्लैंक के रूप में वापसी कर रहे हैं, वहीं जोश ओ'कॉनर ने फ़ादर जड डुपलेन्टिसी (एक पूर्व बॉक्सर से पादरी बने) के रूप में अपनी आश्चर्यजनक हास्य प्रतिभा का प्रदर्शन करते हुए फिल्म में लगभग पूरी तरह से अपनी छाप छोड़ी है और उनकी खूब प्रशंसा की जा रही है।

यह रहस्य चिमनी रॉक के एक रहस्यमय, नव-गॉथिक गाँव में खुलता है, जो अगाथा क्रिस्टी के उपन्यासों की याद दिलाता है। यहाँ जड को जोश ब्रोलिन द्वारा निभाए गए तेजतर्रार और निंदक मॉन्सिग्नोर जेफरसन विक्स के अधीन काम करने के लिए नियुक्त किया जाता है। जॉनसन एक गहरे स्वर को गहन विषयों और गॉथिक माहौल के साथ सफलतापूर्वक मिलाते हैं, और साथ ही वे फ्रेंचाइजी की अब तक की सबसे मजेदार और चंचल पटकथा पेश करते हैं। यह पटकथा गैर-पारंपरिक संवादों, साहित्यिक संदर्भों और मेटा-कमेंट्री से भरपूर है।

रहस्य कहानियों की जड़ों और एडगर एलन पो के अपराधबोध के विषयों से प्रेरणा लेते हुए, जॉनसन आत्मविश्वास के साथ क्लासिक ट्रॉप्स (प्रतिमानों) को कुशलता से ढालते हैं। जहाँ ब्लैंक अपनी विशिष्ट अकड़ (स्वाभाविक अंदाज) के साथ एक हत्या को सुलझाने के लिए पहुँचते हैं, वहीं उनकी भूमिका एक ""ऑर्केस्ट्रा कंडक्टर"" के समान अधिक है, जो कहानी और उसके विविध पात्रों का मार्गदर्शन करते हैं, और वह जड की मदद भी लेते हैं। ओ'कॉनर द्वारा हास्य और गंभीरता के सुंदर संतुलन के साथ निभाए गए जड, फिल्म के केंद्रीय सूत्रधार बन जाते हैं। कथा रचनात्मक रूप से एक दृष्टिकोण (पॉइंट-ऑफ-व्यू) उपकरण का उपयोग करती है, जो ""गुड फ्राइडे हत्या"" सहित प्रमुख घटनाओं को जड के परिप्रेक्ष्य से प्रस्तुत करती है, जिससे उन मंडली के सदस्यों को पेश किया जाता है जिनमें विक्स के प्रति पंथ जैसी भक्ति है।",en,[],,"Daniel Craig returns as Benoit Blanc and Josh O'Connor nearly steals the show in the ""darkest"" but also ""most playful"" instalment of the Knives Out franchise so far.",[''],www.bbc.com/culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It cost Dudley £1,000 ($1,400) a day – millions in today's money, and the whole extravaganza has been interpreted as an elaborate and expensive courtship display; the 16th-Century ruling class's equivalent of hiring a plane to fly a ""Marry Me"" banner. ""The 1575 festivities were an attempt to woo Elizabeth – marriage is a theme in some of the events,"" Jeremy Ashbee, head curator of properties at English Heritage, tells the BBC. ""Dr Elizabeth Goldring, who has made a detailed study of Lord Leicester, has called it 'his last throw of the dice'."" Dudley's gamble seemed to be going swimmingly, but then everything changed. The highlight of the stay was to have been a masque – or performance – on Wednesday 20 July. It never took place. Was it simply a case of bad weather preventing the event, as the official version had it? Or had the monarch got wind of the subject matter and been angered? The masque featured Diana, goddess of chastity, searching for one of her chaste nymphs, pointedly called Zabetta – a version of the name Elizabeth. Alamy In the 1998 film Elizabeth, the bond between the pair was explored (Credit: Alamy) It concluded with a messenger of Juno, goddess of marriage, directly addressing Elizabeth, and imploring her not to follow the path of Diana but to marry instead. Dudley had a certain amount of leeway with the Queen, but this perhaps was going too far. Whatever the reason, the masque never took place, and the revelries were over. The Queen remained in her quarters for a few more days before leaving on 27 July. 'Proud and fiery' Now, the artist Lindsey Mendick has marked the 450th anniversary of the visit by creating Wicked Game, a large sculptural installation at the castle. Wicked Game takes inspiration from ancient mythology as well as from the events of Elizabeth's visit, and the way in which she used her unwed state in her shrewd political manoeuvres throughout her 45-year reign. There are 13 different tableaux. Some are sinister, others are suffused with dark humour. The fragmented ceramic sculptures strikingly depict the Queen and those around her as animals. In the central piece, Elizabeth is a lion and Dudley is a bear. The tableaux are positioned on pieces of an exploded giant chessboard.","The White House's construction spared no expense, with an estimated cost of $1.5 billion. Similarly extravagant, Robert Dudley hosted Queen Elizabeth I at Kenilworth Castle in 1575, spending £1,000 ($1,400) daily—millions in today's money—in a lavish attempt to woo her and propose marriage. Scholars describe this as Dudley's ""last throw of the dice.""

A highlight of the week-long festivities was to be a masque on July 20th, featuring Diana, goddess of chastity, searching for a nymph named ""Zabetta"" (a version of Elizabeth). The 1998 film ""Elizabeth"" suggests the masque concluded with a messenger of Juno, goddess of marriage, directly imploring Elizabeth to marry, rather than follow Diana's chaste path.

However, the masque never took place. While the official reason cited bad weather, speculation suggests the monarch was angered by the masque's thinly veiled subject matter, perceiving it as Dudley overstepping his bounds in pressuring her for marriage. The revelries concluded, and the Queen departed on July 27th.

The 450th anniversary of this historic visit is now commemorated by artist Lindsey Mendick's ""Wicked Game,"" a large sculptural installation at Kenilworth Castle. Inspired by ancient mythology, Elizabeth's visit, and her shrewd political use of her unwed status throughout her 45-year reign, the installation features 13 fragmented ceramic tableaux. These sinister and darkly humorous pieces depict the Queen and those around her as animals, with Elizabeth as a lion and Dudley as a bear, all positioned on pieces of an exploded giant chessboard.","यहाँ उस अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

व्हाइट हाउस के निर्माण में कोई खर्च नहीं छोड़ा गया, जिसकी अनुमानित लागत $1.5 बिलियन थी। इसी तरह की फिजूलखर्ची करते हुए, रॉबर्ट डडली ने 1575 में केनिलवर्थ कैसल में महारानी एलिजाबेथ प्रथम की मेज़बानी की थी। उन्हें रिझाने और शादी का प्रस्ताव देने के एक भव्य प्रयास में, उन्होंने प्रतिदिन £1,000 ($1,400) खर्च किए, जो आज के समय में लाखों-करोड़ों रुपये के बराबर होंगे। विद्वान इसे डडली का ""आखिरी दाँव"" बताते हैं।

एक सप्ताह तक चलने वाले इन उत्सवों का एक मुख्य आकर्षण 20 जुलाई को होने वाला एक मुखौटा नाटक था। इसमें पवित्रता की देवी डायना को ""ज़ाबेटा"" (एलिजाबेथ का एक रूप) नामक एक अप्सरा की तलाश करते हुए दिखाया जाना था। 1998 की फिल्म 'एलिजाबेथ' बताती है कि इस मुखौटा नाटक का समापन विवाह की देवी जूनो के एक दूत द्वारा सीधे एलिजाबेथ से शादी करने का आग्रह करने के साथ हुआ, बजाय इसके कि वह डायना के पवित्र मार्ग का अनुसरण करें।

हालाँकि, यह मुखौटा नाटक कभी हो नहीं सका। इसका आधिकारिक कारण खराब मौसम बताया गया, लेकिन अटकलें बताती हैं कि महारानी इस मुखौटा नाटक की कमोबेश स्पष्ट विषय-वस्तु से क्रोधित थीं। उन्होंने इसे डडली द्वारा शादी के लिए उन पर दबाव डालने में अपनी सीमाओं का उल्लंघन माना। उत्सव समाप्त हो गए, और महारानी 27 जुलाई को प्रस्थान कर गईं।

इस ऐतिहासिक यात्रा की 450वीं वर्षगाँठ को अब कलाकार लिंडसे मेंडिक के 'विकेड गेम' नामक एक विशाल मूर्तिकला प्रतिष्ठान द्वारा केनिलवर्थ कैसल में स्मरण किया जा रहा है। प्राचीन पौराणिक कथाओं, एलिजाबेथ की यात्रा, और अपने 45 साल के शासनकाल के दौरान अपनी अविवाहित स्थिति के उनके चतुर राजनीतिक उपयोग से प्रेरित होकर, इस प्रतिष्ठान में 13 खंडित सिरेमिक झाँकियाँ शामिल हैं। ये भयावह और गहरे विनोदी टुकड़े महारानी और उनके आसपास के लोगों को जानवरों के रूप में दर्शाते हैं, जिसमें एलिजाबेथ को एक शेरनी और डडली को एक भालू के रूप में दिखाया गया है। ये सभी एक फटे हुए विशाल शतरंज बोर्ड के टुकड़ों पर स्थित हैं।",en,[],,Elizabeth I is the only English queen never to have married.

सीईओ स्टीव मार्मियन ने इस बदलाव को ""एक महत्वपूर्ण मोड़"" बताया। उन्होंने कहा कि यह उद्योग के उन दबावों के कारण हुआ है जिसमें घटती फंडिंग के बीच ""नए दर्शकों को खोजने और आवश्यक बने रहने के नए तरीके खोजने"" की आवश्यकता थी। थिएटर का लक्ष्य इन ""भविष्योन्मुखी स्थानों"" के माध्यम से स्थानीय कलाकारों को विश्व स्तर पर लॉन्च करना और नए दर्शकों को जोड़ना है।

महत्वपूर्ण बात यह है कि इस परियोजना में महत्वपूर्ण पर्यावरणीय उन्नयन (अपग्रेड) शामिल हैं, जिसमें गैस बॉयलर को ऊर्जा-कुशल एयर सोर्स हीट पंपों से बदल दिया गया है। इन सुधारों से थिएटर के कार्बन उत्सर्जन में 75% की कमी आने का अनुमान है, जिससे 20 वर्षों में लगभग 1,300 टन CO₂ की बचत होगी। यह वाटफोर्ड बोरो काउंसिल के जलवायु लक्ष्यों के अनुरूप भी है। यह परिवर्तन सैलिक्स पब्लिक सेक्टर डीकार्बोनाइजेशन स्कीम और द बैकस्टेज ट्रस्ट से प्राप्त फंडिंग के माध्यम से संभव हुआ।",en,[],,Watford Palace Theatre takes centre stage as it unveils five newly developed creative spaces.,[''],www.bbc.com/arts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The novelist can tell you what it felt like."" And Carson's achievement is to bring to vivid life the fictional Kluger family, residing near the mountains south of Munich who over the course of six months – Christmas Eve 1932 to Midsummer Night 1933 – see their lives shattered. Carson wrote Crooked Cross – the title refers to the swastika symbol adopted by the Nazis – at speed. It was published in 1934, a year after the events she recounts. Reviews were laudatory, and Carson turned her novel into a play that premiered at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre in 1935, transferring to London's West End two years later. Carson proved remarkably prescient about the horrors to come, and yet after her premature death, in 1941 from breast cancer, her novel sank into obscurity. Persephone's decision to reissue it now is a wise and welcome one. Persephone Books Sylvia ""Sally"" Carson was inspired to write a novel about the dawn of Nazi tyranny in a small German town (Credit: Persephone Books) The action opens when Hans and Rosa Kluger, and their three adult children – daughter Lexa, and sons Helmy and Erich – gather for the Christmas holiday. Life is hard in Depression-era Germany. Herr Kluger's salary at the Post Office has been cut, eldest son Helmy is out of work, and Erich's seasonal job as a ski instructor requires humiliating catering to the whims of rich women. But Christmas is ""a time for the knitting together of personal happiness, and of completing the magic circle of their family,"" Carson writes. Lexa's handsome and successful fiancé, the young surgeon Moritz Weissman, is included in all the celebrations. When Helmy and Lexa take charge of decorating the tree – the two siblings have always been close – the festive setting is described precisely, with a passing reference to ""Helmy's picture of Hitler"" that sits on the piano, decorated with fir twigs, like everything else in the cosy house. The scene lulls the reader into believing, despite the flicker of menace, that nothing can break this loyal, decent and loving clan.","Inspired by US novelist EL Doctorow's distinction between a historian telling ""what happened"" and a novelist conveying ""what it felt like,"" Sally Carson's remarkably prescient 1934 novel, *Crooked Cross* (a reference to the swastika), is being reissued by Persephone after decades of obscurity.

Carson, who also wrote about the Great Depression, penned the book quickly, publishing it just a year after the events it depicts. It vividly portrays the fictional Kluger family, residing near Munich, whose lives are shattered over six pivotal months, from Christmas Eve 1932 to Midsummer Night 1933, as Nazi tyranny begins to take hold.

The novel opens during a difficult Depression-era Christmas for the Klugers, a time of financial struggles for Hans and Rosa and their adult children, Lexa, Helmy, and Erich, despite their efforts to preserve family happiness. Lexa's handsome surgeon fiancé, Moritz Weissman, joins their celebrations, while subtle ominous details like ""Helmy's picture of Hitler"" on the piano hint at the looming menace.

Despite receiving laudatory reviews and being adapted into a successful play that transferred to London's West End, Carson's insightful work, written before her premature death in 1941, faded from public memory. Its current reissue is a timely and welcome decision, allowing a new generation to experience its powerful depiction of a family's unraveling at the dawn of Nazi Germany.","अमेरिकी उपन्यासकार ईएल डॉक्टरोव के इस अंतर से प्रेरित होकर कि एक इतिहासकार 'जो हुआ' बताता है और एक उपन्यासकार 'जो महसूस हुआ' उसे व्यक्त करता है, सैली कार्सन का असाधारण रूप से दूरदर्शी 1934 का उपन्यास, *क्रुक्ड क्रॉस* (जो स्वस्तिक का संदर्भ है), दशकों की गुमनामी के बाद पर्सेफनी द्वारा पुन: प्रकाशित किया जा रहा है।

कार्सन, जिन्होंने महामंदी पर भी लिखा था, ने यह किताब तेज़ी से लिखी और जिन घटनाओं को यह दर्शाती है, उनके ठीक एक साल बाद इसे प्रकाशित कर दिया। यह म्यूनिख के पास रहने वाले काल्पनिक क्लूगर परिवार का सजीव चित्रण करती है, जिनका जीवन क्रिसमस ईव 1932 से मिडसमर नाइट 1933 तक के छह महत्वपूर्ण महीनों में बिखर जाता है, जब नाज़ी अत्याचार अपनी पकड़ बनाना शुरू करते हैं।

उपन्यास की शुरुआत क्लूगर परिवार के लिए महामंदी के दौर की एक मुश्किल क्रिसमस से होती है। यह हैंस और रोज़ा तथा उनके वयस्क बच्चों लेक्सा, हेल्मी और एरिख के लिए वित्तीय संघर्ष का समय है, परिवार की खुशियों को बनाए रखने के उनके प्रयासों के बावजूद। लेक्सा का सुंदर सर्जन मंगेतर, मोरिट्ज़ वीसमैन, उनके समारोहों में शामिल होता है, जबकि पियानो पर 'हेल्मी की हिटलर की तस्वीर' जैसे सूक्ष्म अशुभ विवरण आसन्न खतरे का संकेत देते हैं।

सराहनीय समीक्षाएँ मिलने और एक सफल नाटक में रूपांतरित होने के बावजूद, जिसे लंदन के वेस्ट एंड में भी प्रदर्शित किया गया था, कार्सन का यह गहन कार्य, जो 1941 में उनकी असामयिक मृत्यु से पहले लिखा गया था, सार्वजनिक स्मृति से ओझल हो गया। इसका वर्तमान पुन:प्रकाशन एक सामयिक और स्वागत योग्य निर्णय है, जो एक नई पीढ़ी को नाज़ी जर्मनी के उदय के समय एक परिवार के बिखरने के इसके शक्तिशाली चित्रण का अनुभव करने का अवसर देता है।",en,[],,"Published years before WW2, Sally Carson's prescient novel captures the dawn of Nazi tyranny in a small German town – and remains relevant today.",[''],www.bbc.com/arts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why did sunflowers obsess him and so many other artists before and since? When we think about Vincent van Gogh, most people will instantly call to mind his iconic, boldly executed and citrus-warm sunflowers. It's a piece of brand recognition that the artist fully intended. ""The sunflower is mine"", he once wrote, betraying his desire to be publicly associated with this brazen, man-sized plant and its swaggering, flame-maned crown of petals. Sunflowers clearly had a deep significance for him. So what, if anything, did Vincent intend to symbolise with his beloved helianthus annuus? Alongside Starry Night, the National Gallery in London's Sunflowers is perhaps his most recognisable artwork. But the artist also painted 10 other canvases that focused on these flowers. They came in three short bursts of inspiration. First was a series of four created in Paris in 1887. The second batch of four canvases were created in less than a week after his move to the southern French city of Arles in 1888. The third phase (in early 1889) involved copying three of the previous year's compositions. The most famous versions from 1888 were painted in a flurry of confidence and sensual joy, ""with the gusto of a Marseillaise eating bouillabaisse,"" as he put it. And yet, when he wrote about sunflowers in his letters, Van Gogh never made clear statements about what they truly meant to him. The National Gallery, London Alongside Starry Night, Sunflowers is Van Gogh's most recognisable artwork (Credit: The National Gallery, London) On one hand they appear to be a vehicle for experimenting with colour combinations – particularly the pairings of different shades of yellow. But they were also intended to fill a house where a fellow artist, Paul Gauguin, was due to live. Gauguin had admired Van Gogh's previous sunflower paintings, so perhaps they embodied the artist's irrepressible hopes for solidarity and friendship – desires that would ultimately be thwarted along with Vincent's yearning for artistic recognition in his lifetime. Gauguin left Van Gogh after only two months, and Vincent would die at the age of 37 having failed to sell many of his own artworks.","Vincent van Gogh's iconic ""Sunflowers"" series is central to his renown and influence, with the artist actively seeking public association with the vibrant plant, famously declaring, ""The sunflower is mine."" These flowers held deep personal significance for him, symbolizing love and hope.

While the National Gallery's ""Sunflowers"" is among his most recognizable works, Van Gogh actually painted at least ten other canvases featuring the flowers in three distinct creative bursts. The first series of four was produced in Paris in 1887, followed by another four in Arles in 1888, painted with a ""flurry of confidence and sensual joy."" A final phase in 1889 involved copying earlier compositions.

Despite his clear obsession, Van Gogh never explicitly detailed the sunflowers' meaning in his letters. However, some were intended to decorate a house for fellow artist Paul Gauguin, suggesting they may have embodied his hopes for solidarity and friendship. Tragically, Gauguin's eventual departure and Van Gogh's early death at 37, having sold few of his works, stand in stark contrast to the enduring global fame and symbolic power of his beloved sunflowers.","**विन्सेंट वैन गॉग की प्रतिष्ठित 'सनफ्लावर्स' (सूरजमुखी) श्रृंखला उनकी प्रसिद्धि और प्रभाव का केंद्र है। कलाकार सक्रिय रूप से इस चमकीले पौधे के साथ सार्वजनिक जुड़ाव चाहते थे, और उन्होंने प्रसिद्ध रूप से घोषणा की थी, ""सूरजमुखी मेरा है।"" ये फूल उनके लिए गहरा व्यक्तिगत महत्व रखते थे, जो प्रेम और आशा का प्रतीक थे।**

**हालाँकि नेशनल गैलरी की 'सनफ्लावर्स' उनकी सबसे अधिक पहचानी जाने वाली कृतियों में से एक है, वैन गॉग ने वास्तव में तीन अलग-अलग रचनात्मक चरणों में इन फूलों को दर्शाने वाले कम से कम दस अन्य कैनवस चित्रित किए थे। चार चित्रों की पहली श्रृंखला 1887 में पेरिस में बनाई गई थी, जिसके बाद 1888 में आर्ल्स में चार और चित्र ""आत्मविश्वास और इंद्रिय सुख की लहर"" के साथ चित्रित किए गए। 1889 में एक अंतिम चरण में, उन्होंने अपनी पहले की रचनाओं की नकल की थी।**

**अपनी स्पष्ट धुन (जुनून) के बावजूद, वैन गॉग ने अपने पत्रों में सूरजमुखी के अर्थ का कभी स्पष्ट रूप से विस्तार से वर्णन नहीं किया। हालाँकि, कुछ चित्र साथी कलाकार पॉल गाउगुइन के घर को सजाने के उद्देश्य से बनाए गए थे, जिससे यह पता चलता है कि वे एकजुटता और दोस्ती के लिए उनकी आशाओं का प्रतीक रहे होंगे। दुखद रूप से, गाउगुइन का अंततः चले जाना और वैन गॉग की 37 वर्ष की कम उम्र में मृत्यु (जब उन्होंने अपने बहुत कम काम बेचे थे), उनके प्रिय सूरजमुखी की स्थायी वैश्विक प्रसिद्धि और प्रतीकात्मक शक्ति के बिल्कुल विपरीत है।**",en,[],,They helped to make Vincent van Gogh among the most famous and influential painters in the history of art.

The greatest works of art see seeing differently. From Jan van Eyck's The Arnolfini Portrait, 1434, with its bulbous fish-eye looking glass bolted to the back of the bedroom, warping reality, to Édouard Manet's A Bar at the Folies-Bergère, 1882, and its riddling ricochet of stares, these paintings play with our perspective and offer flashes of the world in all its strangeness. Some paintings perform their magic more stealthily, of course, without a mirror in sight. Take Georges Seurat's seemingly straightforward exaltation of summer, Bathers at Asnières, 1884 – a painting that, on closer inspection, peels away at our perception of perception with a passion and intensity that makes it as urgent and relevant today as it ever was. At first glance, Seurat's colossal 2m x 3m (79in x 118in) canvas – much larger than gallery-goers were accustomed to encountering – is an outsized celebration of the lazy luminosity of the season, enshrining the relaxed mood of workers on a break from nearby factories as they bathe in etherealising sunshine along the banks of the Seine, northwest of central Paris. The light that polishes the pallid skin of figures who have spent too long stewing in the sooty fug of sunless foundries (those ""dark Satanic mills"" of which William Blake once wrote) seems initially to bestow on them a monumentality rarely seen in contemporary art and a grandeur typically reserved for the depiction of myth and history. Look closer, however, and their smooth and deceptively solid physiques suddenly begin to unstitch themselves, unweaving into a loosening mesh of pulsing photons – waves of pure hue and pigment distinct from form. The workers are animated in their motionlessness: hefty and weightless in equal measure. Bathers at Asnières is a deft dissection of the mirage of superficial appearances – an elaborate exercise in the undoing of the social and psychological veils that shape our world In Seurat's hands, the very property of light, that most fundamental element that makes perception possible, is no longer a straightforward source of illumination. It is a substance that can, and must, be pulled apart and put back together again. Far from a simple celebration of summer indolence or the unwinding of mind and muscle against a tapestry of afternoon heat and haze, Bathers at Asnières is a deft dissection of the mirage of superficial appearances – an elaborate exercise in the undoing of the social and psychological veils that shroud our seeing and shape our world. It is a painting that sees into the life of things.","Georges Seurat's **Bathers at Asnières** is lauded as a ""modern wonder"" that profoundly redefines how we perceive the world, earning its place among works like Van Eyck's *The Arnolfini Portrait* and Manet's *A Bar at the Folies-Bergère* for its unique vision.

The colossal 2m x 3m canvas, an ""exquisite distillation of the essence of summer,"" depicts factory workers bathing in ethereal sunlight. Seurat's genius lies in his revolutionary depiction of light: initially bestowing a monumental quality on the figures, a closer look reveals them ""unstitching"" into a ""loosening mesh of pulsing photons."" This makes the workers appear simultaneously ""hefty and weightless,"" ""animated in their motionlessness,"" as if floating.

Ultimately, *Bathers at Asnières* serves as a ""deft dissection of the mirage of superficial appearances."" Seurat treats light not merely as illumination but as a substance to be ""pulled apart and put back together,"" revealing it as a fundamental element that both enables and complicates perception. The painting thus becomes an elaborate exercise in ""undoing the social and psychological veils that shroud our seeing,"" offering a deep insight ""into the life of things.""","जॉर्ज सेरात की **बाथर्स एट आनियर (Bathers at Asnières)** को एक ""आधुनिक चमत्कार"" के रूप में सराहा जाता है जो दुनिया को देखने के हमारे नज़रिए को गहराई से पुनर्परिभाषित करती है। अपनी अनूठी परिकल्पना के लिए, यह वैन आइक की *द अर्नोल्फिनी पोर्ट्रेट (The Arnolfini Portrait)* और मानेट की *ए बार एट द फोलीज-बर्गेर (A Bar at the Folies-Bergère)* जैसी कृतियों में अपना विशिष्ट स्थान बनाती है।

2 मीटर x 3 मीटर का विशालकाय कैनवास, जिसे ""गर्मियों के सार का एक उत्कृष्ट निचोड़"" कहा गया है, अलौकिक सूर्यप्रकाश में स्नान करते कारखाने के मज़दूरों को चित्रित करता है। सेरात की प्रतिभा प्रकाश के उनके क्रांतिकारी चित्रण में निहित है: जहाँ शुरू में ये आकृतियाँ स्मारकीय गुणवत्ता लिए हुए दिखती हैं, वहीं करीब से देखने पर वे ""स्पंदित होते फोटॉनों के एक खुलते हुए जाल"" में ""बिखरती"" हुई प्रतीत होती हैं। यह मज़दूरों को एक साथ ""भारी-भरकम और भारहीन"", तथा ""अपनी निश्चलता में सजीव"" दिखाता है, मानो वे हवा में तैर रहे हों।

अंततः, *बाथर्स एट आनियर* ""सतही दिखावों की मृगतृष्णा का एक कुशल विवेचन"" प्रस्तुत करती है। सेरात प्रकाश को मात्र रोशनी नहीं, बल्कि एक ऐसे पदार्थ के रूप में मानते हैं जिसे ""अलग किया जा सकता है और फिर से जोड़ा जा सकता है"", इसे एक ऐसे मौलिक तत्व के रूप में प्रकट करते हैं जो हमारी बोध शक्ति को सक्षम भी बनाता है और उसे जटिल भी करता है। इस प्रकार यह पेंटिंग ""हमारी दृष्टि को ढँके हुए सामाजिक और मनोवैज्ञानिक पर्दों को खोलने का एक विस्तृत अभ्यास"" बन जाती है, जो ""वस्तुओं के जीवन"" में गहरी अंतर्दृष्टि प्रदान करती है।",en,[],,"Georges Seurat's once-mocked painting Bathers at Asnières is both an ""exquisite distillation of the very essence of summer"" and ""a modern wonder in the art of seeing"".",[''],www.bbc.com/arts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was subsequently published in book form by Bloodaxe Books in November 1985 and, again, troubled neither the UK's legislature nor its newspapers. Neil Astley, founder of Bloodaxe Books, and still the publisher's editor and managing director, recalls that, soon after the publication of the poem as a book, Harrison performed the entire thing in a late-night arts slot on Tyne Tees Television, which catered specifically to audiences in North East England, and ""it went out without arousing any opposition as far as I'm aware"". The moment of impact But then in 1987, it became known that a televised version of the poem had been made for national broadcaster Channel 4, directed by celebrated theatre director Richard Eyre and featuring Harrison reading the poem along with footage of, among other things, striking miners, Holbeck Cemetery and Thatcher doing a ""victory"" sign. At that point, all hell broke loose. In October, a few weeks before its broadcast, the Daily Mail reported on the ""FOUR LETTER TV POEM FURY"" on its front page. The activist and anti-obscenity campaigner Mary Whitehouse called the poem a ""work of singular nastiness"". Conservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth, who earlier that year had attempted to introduce legislation that would make it a crime to air material that might cause ""gross offence"" to a ""reasonable person"", was another who opposed its broadcast. He officially called for a debate in the House of Commons to try to stop it. One hundred and twenty one MPs signed the proposal. Howarth later admitted he had not read the poem in full. Harrison recalled in the 2013 BBC Radio 4 documentary, Exploring V, that at the height of the furore, a reporter from the Telegraph knocked on his door. ""I said, 'Have you read the poem?'’ He said,'No. I'm New'."" The irony is that while [publisher] Bloodaxe had sold a couple of thousand copies of the poem before 1987, as a result of the attacks on the Channel 4 film, it reached an audience of millions – Neil Astley Opposition to the TV programme came principally from right wing commentators but the Sunday Telegraph columnist and editor of the Literary Review, Auberon Waugh, whom no-one had ever mistaken for a left winger, found the poem ""well written and extremely moving"", as he wrote in his Telegraph column at the time. Ian Hislop, the editor of UK satirical magazine Private Eye, wrote an article defending it in The Listener, as did Bernard Levin in the Times, calling it ""powerful, profound and haunting"". And the Independent printed the whole poem in its news pages, with an introduction by Blake Morrison in which he wrote: ""Those MPs are right to believe that the poem is shocking but not because of its language. It shocks because it describes unflinchingly what is meant by a divided society, because it takes the abstractions we have learned to live with – unemployment, racial tension, inequality, deprivation – and gives them a kind of physical existence on the page.""","Thomas Harrison's poem ""V"" sparked a major controversy in 1987 following its televised broadcast on Channel 4, despite its earlier publications receiving no public backlash.

Initially printed in the London Review of Books and later published in book form by Bloodaxe Books in 1985, ""V"" garnered little attention. Its first public performance by Harrison on Tyne Tees Television also passed without incident.

The furore erupted after a 1987 televised version, directed by Richard Eyre and featuring Harrison reading the poem, was scheduled to air on Channel 4. Weeks before its broadcast, the Daily Mail ran a front-page exposé titled ""FOUR LETTER TV POEM FURY."" Anti-obscenity campaigner Mary Whitehouse condemned it as ""a work of singular nastiness.""

Conservative MP Sir Gerald Howarth, who had previously advocated for legislation against ""gross offence"" material, vehemently opposed the broadcast. He called for a House of Commons debate to halt its airing, gaining the support of 121 MPs. Ironically, Howarth later admitted he had not read the entire poem. Harrison himself recalled a reporter from The Telegraph, during the height of the controversy, admitting they hadn't read the poem when questioned.

Despite the widespread criticism, ""V"" found vocal defenders. Ian Hislop of Private Eye championed it in The Listener, and Bernard Levin in The Times described it as ""powerful, profound and haunting."" The Independent went as far as to print the entire poem in its news pages, with Blake Morrison's introduction arguing that its shock value stemmed not from its language, but from its unflinching depiction of a divided society.

Ultimately, the controversy significantly amplified the poem's reach. Neil Astley, founder of Bloodaxe Books, noted the irony: the intense attacks on the Channel 4 film propelled ""V"" from selling thousands to reaching an audience of millions.","**थॉमस हैरिसन की कविता ""वी"" पर 1987 में एक बड़ा विवाद**

थॉमस हैरिसन की कविता ""वी"" ने 1987 में चैनल 4 पर इसके टेलीविज़न प्रसारण के बाद एक बड़ा विवाद खड़ा कर दिया, जबकि इसके पहले के प्रकाशनों को जनता की ओर से कोई खास विरोध नहीं मिला था।

शुरुआत में इसे लंदन रिव्यू ऑफ बुक्स में छापा गया था और बाद में 1985 में ब्लडएक्स बुक्स द्वारा पुस्तक के रूप में प्रकाशित किया गया था, लेकिन ""वी"" को तब बहुत कम लोगों का ध्यान मिला। हैरिसन द्वारा टाइन टीज़ टेलीविज़न पर इसकी पहली सार्वजनिक प्रस्तुति भी बिना किसी घटना (यानी, विवाद) के संपन्न हो गई थी।

विवाद तब भड़का जब 1987 में एक टेलीविज़न संस्करण, जिसका निर्देशन रिचर्ड आइरे ने किया था और जिसमें हैरिसन कविता पढ़ रहे थे, चैनल 4 पर प्रसारित होने वाला था। इसके प्रसारण से कुछ हफ़्ते पहले, डेली मेल ने एक मुखपृष्ठ पर ""फोर लेटर टीवी पोएम फ्यूरी"" शीर्षक से सनसनीखेज़ खुलासा छापा। अश्लीलता विरोधी अभियानकर्ता मैरी व्हाइटहाउस ने इसे ""एक अद्वितीय घृणित कृति"" कहकर इसकी निंदा की।

कंज़र्वेटिव सांसद सर गेराल्ड हॉवर्थ, जिन्होंने पहले ""घोर आपत्तिजनक"" सामग्री के खिलाफ कानून बनाने की वकालत की थी, ने इस प्रसारण का पुरजोर विरोध किया। उन्होंने इसके प्रसारण को रोकने के लिए हाउस ऑफ कॉमन्स में एक बहस की मांग की और 121 सांसदों का समर्थन प्राप्त किया। विडंबना यह है कि हॉवर्थ ने बाद में स्वीकार किया कि उन्होंने पूरी कविता नहीं पढ़ी थी। हैरिसन ने खुद याद किया कि विवाद के चरम पर, द टेलीग्राफ के एक रिपोर्टर ने पूछे जाने पर स्वीकार किया कि उन्होंने भी कविता नहीं पढ़ी थी।

व्यापक आलोचना के बावजूद, ""वी"" को मुखर समर्थक भी मिले। प्राइवेट आई के इयान हिसलोप ने द लिसनर में इसका समर्थन किया, और द टाइम्स में बर्नार्ड लेविन ने इसे ""शक्तिशाली, गहरा और भावुक करने वाला"" बताया। द इंडिपेंडेंट ने तो अपनी समाचार पृष्ठों में पूरी कविता छाप दी, साथ ही ब्लेक मॉरिसन की प्रस्तावना में यह तर्क दिया गया कि इसका चौंकाने वाला मूल्य इसकी भाषा से नहीं, बल्कि एक विभाजित समाज के इसके अडिग चित्रण से उत्पन्न हुआ था।

अंततः, इस विवाद ने कविता की पहुँच को काफी बढ़ा दिया। ब्लडएक्स बुक्स के संस्थापक नील एस्टले ने इस विडंबना को रेखांकित किया: चैनल 4 की फिल्म पर हुए तीव्र हमलों ने ""वी"" को हज़ारों की बिक्री से लाखों दर्शकों तक पहुँचा दिया।",en,[],,"Forty years ago, Northern English poet Harrison published a powerful work inspired by vandalised gravestones in his hometown Leeds.",[''],www.bbc.com/arts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A decade after Warhol's death in 1987, Wainwright, then writing a doctorate on Warhol's audio tapes, travelled back and forth to his home town of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to interview the artist's inner circle and to work her way through the more than 2,000 cassette recordings made by Warhol of the events he attended, the conversations he had and his private thoughts. The Andy Warhol Foundation has now placed the tapes under embargo until 50 years after his death (2037), meaning that people can listen to them but not transcribe them. So, no-one knows their contents better than Wainwright. ""I had been given access in a way that nobody had before,"" she tells the BBC. ""I got a real sense of him as a person."" Andy Warhol Foundation/ Licensed by DACS, London/ Courtesy Westwood Gallery NYC Mona Lisa (Four Times) (1979) is one of Warhol's most iconic artworks (Credit: Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts / Licensed by DACS, London/ Courtesy Westwood Gallery NYC) Say the name ""Andy Warhol"", and a very particular image springs to mind: an aloof and effortlessly cool member of the New York avant-garde art scene; a style-setter dressed in dark glasses, leather jacket and spiky ""fright"" wig, who attracted a constellation of stars to the hedonistic gatherings at his studio, The Factory. ""We think of him being a party animal and the epicentre of New York,"" says Wainwright, but that perception of him changed as her research deepened. ""I realised as soon as I started listening to the tapes and meeting the family that he was such a multi-faceted person,"" she says, describing herself ""like a detective piecing things together"". The biggest misconception about Warhol, maintains Wainwright, is ""that he didn't care and he's all about surface"". A 1971 Gerard Malanga photograph titled Andy Warhol in a pensive moment at the Factory, shown for the first time in a museum, helps dispel such myths. Taken the day he learnt that Valerie Solanas, who shot him in 1968, had been released from prison, it depicts a downcast Warhol with a distant look in his eyes. Later in the exhibition, a sketch from 1985/6 – of a skull and a laser focus on a small area of torso – illustrates the profound physical and mental effects of the attack, so grievous that Warhol needed to wear a corset for the rest of his life. A year later, he would die from complications following surgery. ""Actually, he did deeply care,"" says Wainwright. ""He made himself into that character [with wig and glasses], but underneath, there was so much going on, so many human traits: self-doubt, worry, nervousness, shyness, anxieties – all these things that we don't necessarily associate with Warhol."" In his diaries, for example, he described being handed a microphone at a Studio 54 anniversary party in 1978, and being unable to articulate any thoughts into speech: ""I just made sounds… and people laughed,"" he said.","British art historian Professor Jean Wainwright, a world expert on Andy Warhol and a friend of his family, has revealed a new, multifaceted portrait of the iconic artist based on her unprecedented access to his personal archives. Wainwright spent a decade after Warhol's 1987 death working through over 2,000 cassette recordings in Pittsburgh—tapes that the Andy Warhol Foundation has since placed under embargo until 2037, allowing listening but prohibiting transcription.

Wainwright's unique insights challenge the common perception of Warhol as merely an aloof, superficial ""party animal"" at the epicentre of the New York avant-garde. Instead, her research—which she likens to detective work—uncovered a deeply caring individual, concerned about his family and friends, who harbored significant self-doubt, worry, nervousness, shyness, and anxieties beneath his carefully crafted public persona.

This revised understanding is supported by new revelations, including a 1971 Gerard Malanga photograph, displayed for the first time, showing a pensive and downcast Warhol on the day his shooter, Valerie Solanas, was released from prison. Wainwright also highlights Warhol's lifelong need for a corset following the shooting, his premonition of mortality evident in a 1985/6 sketch of a skull and torso (a year before his death from surgical complications), and his personal diaries revealing profound shyness, such as an incident at a 1978 Studio 54 party where he was unable to articulate thoughts, only making ""sounds"" to laughter.","**ब्रिटिश कला इतिहासकार प्रोफेसर जीन वेनराइट ने एंडी वारहोल का एक नया, बहुआयामी चित्र उजागर किया**

ब्रिटिश कला इतिहासकार प्रोफेसर जीन वेनराइट, जो एंडी वारहोल पर एक विश्व विशेषज्ञ और उनके परिवार की मित्र रही हैं, ने उनके निजी अभिलेखागार तक अपनी अभूतपूर्व पहुंच के आधार पर प्रतिष्ठित कलाकार का एक नया, बहुआयामी चित्र उजागर किया है। वारहोल की 1987 में मृत्यु के बाद, वेनराइट ने पिट्सबर्ग में 2,000 से अधिक कैसेट रिकॉर्डिंग का अध्ययन करने में एक दशक बिताया—ये वे टेप हैं जिन पर एंडी वारहोल फाउंडेशन ने 2037 तक प्रतिबंध लगा दिया है, जिसके तहत उन्हें सुना तो जा सकता है लेकिन उनका प्रतिलेखन (transcription) निषिद्ध है।

वेनराइट की अनूठी अंतर्दृष्टि वारहोल को न्यूयॉर्क के अवांत-गार्द (अग्रणी कला आंदोलन) के केंद्र में केवल एक अलग-थलग, सतही 'पार्टी एनिमल' के रूप में देखने की आम धारणा को चुनौती देती हैं। इसके बजाय, उनके शोध ने—जिसे वह जासूसी कार्य के समान मानती हैं—एक ऐसे गहरे परवाह करने वाले व्यक्ति को उजागर किया, जो अपने परिवार और दोस्तों को लेकर चिंतित था, और जिसके सावधानीपूर्वक गढ़े गए सार्वजनिक व्यक्तित्व के नीचे महत्वपूर्ण आत्म-संदेह, चिंता, घबराहट, शर्म और बेचैनी छिपी हुई थी।

यह संशोधित समझ नए खुलासों से समर्थित है, जिसमें पहली बार प्रदर्शित 1971 का जेरार्ड मलंगा का एक चित्र शामिल है, जो उस दिन के विचारमग्न और उदास वारहोल को दर्शाता है जिस दिन उसकी शूटर, वैलेरी सोलानास, जेल से रिहा हुई थी। वेनराइट ने शूटिंग के बाद वारहोल को जीवन भर कॉर्सेट की आवश्यकता, 1985/6 के एक कंकाल और धड़ के रेखाचित्र में (सर्जिकल जटिलताओं से उसकी मृत्यु से एक वर्ष पहले) मृत्यु के प्रति उसके पूर्वाभास, और उसकी व्यक्तिगत डायरियों में प्रकट हुई गहरी शर्म को भी रेखांकित किया है। उदाहरण के तौर पर, 1978 की स्टूडियो 54 पार्टी में एक घटना का जिक्र है जहाँ वह अपने विचारों को व्यक्त करने में असमर्थ था और केवल हँसी के बीच 'आवाजें' ही निकाल पा रहा था।",en,[],,"With his famous wig and shades, Warhol cultivated a mysterious, enigmatic persona.

The Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris has borne witness to many turning points in history. The building's striking gothic stonework has stood sentry on an island in the midst of the River Seine since the late 12th Century as coronations, wars and revolutions have unfolded in its shadow. What you might not realise, however, is that the cathedral has played a key part in shaping the music you hear when you turn on the radio or stream a playlist. Notre-Dame was, for a brief time, the beating heart of a musical revolution – one that changed music forever and laid the foundations for many of the songs we listen to today. Up until the middle of the 12th Century in Medieval Europe, it was common to hear the haunting melodic chants of the clergy echoing through churches and cathedrals. Gregorian chant, or plainsong, was the musical style of the day, where sacred texts were sung either by a single voice or a choir in unison – something known as monophony. But faced with the Notre-Dame's soaring nave, ribbed vaults and towering columns, a group of composers began to try something different to take advantage of the way sound rattled around inside the building. They introduced multiple lines of melody simultaneously to produce elaborate polyphonic arrangements, or motets – the early beginnings of a musical texture that is a common feature in modern music, from jazz to pop and hip-hop.","The iconic Notre-Dame Cathedral, a gothic landmark on an island in the River Seine since the late 12th century, is renowned for witnessing centuries of French history, from coronations to revolutions.

Up until the mid-12th century, the prevailing musical style in Medieval Europe was monophonic Gregorian chant, sung by a single voice or choir in unison. Capitalizing on the cathedral's distinctive acoustics and soaring architecture, composers at Notre-Dame began experimenting, introducing multiple melodic lines simultaneously to create elaborate polyphonic arrangements, or motets.

When it premiered 40 years ago, Amadeus drew an initial wave of praise. A historical drama revolving around the rivalry between two composers, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri, it went on to win eight Oscars, including for best picture. Miloš Forman took home the best director prize, Peter Shaffer won for best adapted screenplay and both of the lead actors were nominated: F Murray Abraham, who played Salieri, beat Tom Hulce, who played Mozart. But in the years that followed, a backlash grew over what some people saw as Amadeus's litany of historical errors. An article in The Guardian declared that ""the fart jokes can't conceal how laughably wrong this is"", and the BBC commented that ""the film plays shamelessly fast and loose with historical fact"". Salieri, critics noted, was no pious bachelor (as attested by his wife, eight children and mistress), and it's after all an odd kind of hateful rivalry when the real Mozart entrusted the musical education of his own son to Salieri. As for Mozart's lewd humor, that cheeky insouciance was actually commonplace in middle-class Viennese society. Most egregiously of all, world-famous Mozart was not dumped in an unmarked pauper's grave. If this is a homage to history, the complaint goes, it's akin to Emperor Joseph II fumbling ineptly on the pianoforte and bungling every other note. But this kind of cavilling may be missing the point. Forman's aim for Amadeus can be seen as radically different from a typical biopic, and that was to use a fictionalised version of an epic clash between musical composers to allegorise the defining global rivalry of the mid-to-late 20th Century: the Cold War. Put simply, the film may have played fast and loose with 1784 because its real preoccupation was 1984.","Miloš Forman's Best Picture-winning film *Amadeus*, celebrating its 40th anniversary, is widely acclaimed as one of the greatest musicals of all time, having secured eight Academy Awards including Best Director for Forman and Best Actor for F. Murray Abraham (who played Antonio Salieri).

Despite its success, the historical drama has faced significant criticism over a ""litany of historical errors."" Publications like The Guardian and BBC have called the film ""laughably wrong"" and ""shamelessly fast and loose with historical fact."" Critics point to inaccuracies such as portraying Salieri as a pious bachelor (when he had a family and was trusted by Mozart), misrepresenting Mozart's lewd humor as unique, and most notably, depicting Mozart's burial in an unmarked pauper's grave.

However, the article suggests these criticisms may miss Forman's true intent. Forman's aim was not a typical biopic but to use a fictionalized version of an epic clash between composers. The film, it argues, deliberately played fast and loose with 18th-century history (1784) because its real preoccupation was to explore themes relevant to its own time of release (1984).","मिलोश फोरमैन की सर्वश्रेष्ठ फ़िल्म का ऑस्कर जीतने वाली फ़िल्म *अमादेयस*, जो अपनी 40वीं वर्षगांठ मना रही है, को सर्वकालिक महानतम संगीतमय फ़िल्मों में से एक माना जाता है। इसने आठ अकादमी पुरस्कार जीते हैं, जिनमें फोरमैन के लिए सर्वश्रेष्ठ निर्देशक और एफ. मरे अब्राहम (जिन्होंने एंटोनियो सालियेरी की भूमिका निभाई थी) के लिए सर्वश्रेष्ठ अभिनेता शामिल हैं।

हालांकि, लेख का सुझाव है कि ये आलोचनाएं फोरमैन के वास्तविक इरादे को समझने में चूक सकती हैं। फोरमैन का उद्देश्य एक सामान्य बायोपिक बनाना नहीं था, बल्कि संगीतकारों के बीच एक महाकाव्य टकराव के काल्पनिक संस्करण का उपयोग करना था। फ़िल्म ने, यह तर्क दिया जाता है, 18वीं सदी के इतिहास (1784) के साथ जानबूझकर छेड़छाड़ की, क्योंकि उसकी वास्तविक चिंता अपने रिलीज़ के समय (1984) से संबंधित विषयों का अन्वेषण करना था।",en,[],,"Released 40 years ago this month, Miloš Forman's best picture-winning Amadeus is often accused of historical inaccuracies – but the film's critics could be missing the point.",[''],www.bbc.com/arts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By now, nearly every aspect of the widely shared photo announcing the engagement of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, posted to Instagram on 26 August 2025, has been carefully combed for hidden clues it may contain about the nature of the couple's simultaneously private and public relationship. From the so-called ""snake lilies"" spotted in the secret garden where Kelce's proposal occurred (allegedly an allusion to the snake symbolism of Swift's 2017 album Reputation), to the rhyming Ralph Lauren outfits worn by the couple, to the lit-wick dynamite emoji that punctuates the teasingly terse caption to the image ""Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married"" – an explosive acronymic pun on TNT, or ""Taylor 'n Travis"" – not a single pixel or petal of the image appears to have been left unturned. But such forensic sifting risks missing the bigger picture. While the photo is in many respects as unique as the ginormous gemstone that now glimmers on Swift's ring finger (an elongated cushion-cut diamond that has been traced back to the studio of New York City-based designer Kindred Lubeck of Artifex Fine Jewelry), the image nevertheless echoes contours of a long tradition in art history of meticulously choreographed courtship. However candid the snapshot seems, it resonates with a rich visual history. It follows rules. With the help of artists from the Northern Renaissance to French Realism of the 19th Century, here is a handy guide for assessing not the ""four cs"" of the gemmologist – cut, colour, clarity and carat – but the ""six cs"" of the sparkling Swift/Kelce stage set.

""Music was played to accompany the most terrible things,"" she said. The then Anita Lasker barely spoke German in public again for 50 years after World War Two, but when she was growing up, her hometown of Breslau was part of Germany. Now known as Wrocław, it has been part of Poland since the end of the war. Lasker's mother Edith was a talented violinist and her father Alfons was a successful lawyer. As the youngest of three daughters, she grew up in a happy home where music and other cultural pursuits were encouraged. She knew at an early age that she wanted to be a cellist, but outside the sanctuary of her family home, darker forces were stirring. She recalled on a BBC television documentary in 1996: ""We were the typical assimilated German-Jewish family. We went to a little private school, and I suddenly heard, 'Don't give the Jew the sponge,' and I thought, 'What is all this?'"" By 1938, as antisemitism took hold in Nazi Germany, Lasker's parents couldn't find a cello tutor in Breslau who would teach a Jewish child. She was sent to Berlin to study, but had to rush back to her parents after a night of murder and mayhem. On 9 November 1938, the insidious persecution of Jewish people turned violent as Nazis smashed the windows of homes, businesses and synagogues on Kristallnacht or ""the night of broken glass"". Back at home, Lasker's parents continued to instil a love of culture in their children, as ""nobody can take that away from us"". Her eldest sister Marianne escaped in 1939 on the Kindertransport, the mission which took thousands of children to safety in Britain just before the war. By 1942, even as ""the world was falling to pieces"", her father still had Anita and her sister Renate discussing sophisticated works such as Friedrich Schiller's tragic play Don Carlos. However, it was ""obvious what was going to happen"", she said.","Anita Lasker, a German-Jewish cellist, survived the Holocaust, her life dramatically altered at Auschwitz where her musical talent provided an unexpected reprieve. Raised in Breslau (now Wrocław) in a cultured family with a violinist mother and lawyer father, Lasker developed an early passion for the cello.

As antisemitism intensified in Nazi Germany, she faced discrimination, including difficulty finding a cello tutor, culminating in the violence of Kristallnacht in 1938. Despite the growing danger, her parents instilled a love of culture, emphasizing that ""nobody can take that away from us."" Her eldest sister, Marianne, escaped via the Kindertransport in 1939, but the rest of the family remained as ""the world was falling to pieces.""

At the Auschwitz ramp, Lasker's casual mention of playing the cello diverted her fate. She recalled music accompanying ""the most terrible things,"" serving as a ""soundtrack"" to the atrocities. After World War Two, Lasker, profoundly impacted by her experiences, barely spoke German for 50 years.","यहाँ अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद दिया गया है:

""Fitzgerald gave some thought to structuring it in the third person but ultimately he chose Nick Carraway, a first-person narrator who would tell Gatsby's story, and who would be an intermediary between us and Gatsby. We have to respond to and understand Gatsby and, as we do so, remain aware that we're approaching him through Nick's very particular perspective, and through Nick's very ambivalent relationship to Gatsby, which is simultaneously full of praise and full of severe criticism, even at some moments contempt,"" he says. Alamy Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan starred in Baz Luhrmann's divisive 2013 film (Credit: Alamy) Like Smith, Cain first encountered the novel as a student. It was a different era – the 1960s – but even so, little attention was paid to Nick. Cain recalls instead talk of symbolism – the legendary green light, for example, and Gatsby's fabled automobile. It's a reminder that, in a way, the education system is as much to blame as pop culture for our limited readings of this seminal text. It may be a Great American Novel but, at fewer than 200 pages, its sublimely economical storytelling makes its study points very easy to access. Ironically, given that this is a novel of illusion and delusion, in which surfaces are crucial, we all too often overlook the texture of its prose. As Cain puts it, ""I think when we consider The Great Gatsby, we need to think about it not just as a novel that is an occasion or a point of departure for us to talk about big American themes and questions, but we have to really enter into the richness of Fitzgerald's actual page-to-page writing. We have to come to Gatsby, yes, aware of its social and cultural significance, but also we need to return to it as a literary experience."" Cain re-reads the novel every two or three years but frequently finds himself thinking about it in between – in 2020, for instance, when US President Biden, accepting the Democratic nomination at the DNC, spoke of the right to pursue dreams of a better future. The American Dream is, of course, another of Gatsby's Big Themes, and one that continues to be misunderstood. ""Fitzgerald shows that that dream is very powerful, but that it is indeed a very hard one for most Americans to realise. It feeds them great hopes, great desires, and it's extraordinary, the efforts that so many of them make to fulfil those dreams and those desires, but that dream is beyond the reach of many, and many, they give up all too much to try to achieve that great success,"" Cain points out. Among the obstacles, Fitzgerald seems to suggest, are hard-and-fast class lines that no amount of money will enable Gatsby to cross. It's a view that resonates with a mood that Cain says he's been picking up on among his students – a certain ""melancholy"" for the American Dream, the feeling fanned by racial and economic inequalities that the pandemic has only deepened.","William Cain, a Wellesley College English professor and American literature expert, emphasizes the crucial yet often-overlooked role of Nick Carraway as the first-person narrator in F. Scott Fitzgerald's *The Great Gatsby*. Cain argues that fully grasping the novel requires acknowledging Nick's specific perspective, a dimension historically neglected by both education and pop culture, which previously fixated on aspects like symbolism.

Beyond Nick, Cain advocates for a deeper engagement with *Gatsby* as a literary experience, urging readers to appreciate its ""sublimely economical storytelling"" and the texture of its prose, rather than solely as a social or cultural touchstone. He also highlights the novel's central, frequently misunderstood theme of the American Dream. Fitzgerald, he explains, portrays this dream as powerful yet ultimately unattainable for many, largely due to insurmountable class lines. This portrayal, Cain notes, resonates with a contemporary ""melancholy"" he observes among his students regarding the American Dream, fueled by current racial and economic inequalities.","वेलेस्ली कॉलेज में अंग्रेज़ी के प्रोफेसर और अमेरिकी साहित्य विशेषज्ञ विलियम केन, एफ. स्कॉट फिट्ज़गेराल्ड के उपन्यास 'द ग्रेट गैट्सबी' में निक कैरावे की प्रथम-पुरुष कथावाचक के रूप में महत्वपूर्ण, फिर भी अक्सर अनदेखी की गई भूमिका पर ज़ोर देते हैं। केन का तर्क है कि उपन्यास को पूरी तरह समझने के लिए निक के विशिष्ट दृष्टिकोण को पहचानना ज़रूरी है, यह एक ऐसा आयाम है जिसे ऐतिहासिक रूप से शिक्षा और पॉप संस्कृति दोनों ने उपेक्षित किया है, जो पहले प्रतीकात्मकता जैसे पहलुओं पर केंद्रित थी।

निक के अलावा, केन 'गैट्सबी' को एक साहित्यिक अनुभव के रूप में गहराई से पढ़ने की वकालत करते हैं। वह पाठकों से आग्रह करते हैं कि वे इसे केवल एक सामाजिक या सांस्कृतिक मानदंड के रूप में देखने के बजाय इसकी ""अत्यंत संक्षिप्त और प्रभावशाली कहानी कहने की कला"" और इसकी गद्य की बनावट की सराहना करें। वह उपन्यास के केंद्रीय, अक्सर गलत समझे जाने वाले अमेरिकी सपने के विषय पर भी प्रकाश डालते हैं। वह समझाते हैं कि फिट्ज़गेराल्ड इस सपने को शक्तिशाली, फिर भी कई लोगों के लिए अंततः अप्राप्य के रूप में चित्रित करते हैं, जिसका मुख्य कारण दुर्गम वर्गीय विभाजन हैं। केन बताते हैं कि यह चित्रण अमेरिकी सपने के संबंध में उनके छात्रों के बीच देखी जाने वाली समकालीन ""उदासी"" से मेल खाता है, जो मौजूदा नस्लीय और आर्थिक असमानताओं से पोषित है।",en,[],,F Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is synonymous with glitz and glamour but this is just one of many myths that have surrounded the book since its first publication in April 1925.,[''],www.bbc.com/arts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The seemingly endless cotton fields and backroads between Jackson, Mississippi, and Memphis, Tennessee, still echo with the sounds of the blues music that was born here. This year, from the city of Jackson, Mississippi to the bright lights of Memphis, Tennessee, destinations all along the Mississippi Blues Trail – a series of more than 200 roadside historical markers scattered across Mississippi and surrounding states – are celebrating what would have been the 100th birthday of a homegrown musical legend. Born 16 September 1925 on a Mississippi plantation, Riley B King – better known to the world as BB King – transformed himself from a sharecropper's son to a household name thanks to his gritty voice, soulful lyrics and distinctive string-bending guitar licks which would come to define the blues. ""His legacy as a musician was to ensure that the blues genre was well-known, respected and appreciated for what it was,"" said Malika Polk-Lee, executive director of the BB King Museum & Delta Interpretive Center in Indianola, Mississippi. ""Mr King was the blues ambassador to the world. Wherever he went, he represented that genre and did it to the best of his ability."" Lauded for his distinctive voice and intricate guitar playing, King won 15 Grammy Awards, received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and was inducted into both Rock & Roll and the Blues Halls of Fame. He is credited by many for helping to bring the blues to a global stage. However, even after international acclaim, King remained a champion of the Southern towns and cities that shaped him. ""He showed us a lot of love, and it continues to this day. We're just glad that he decided to make his way to Memphis and really join that music family that we had at the time,"" said Camille Connor, public relations manager at Memphis Travel. ""He was a big part of opening [BB King's Blues Club and that] opening is really what reinvigorated Beale Street in Memphis. The Beale Street we see today, it really came back because of the draw of that club."" Here are four spots along the Blues Trail where visitors can celebrate BB King and the music he made famous:","Many towns and cities along the Mississippi Blues Trail are celebrating the 100th birthday of legendary musician Riley B.

Despite international acclaim, King remained deeply connected to the Southern towns that shaped him, fostering a lasting legacy of love and support. Notably, his involvement in opening BB King's Blues Club in Memphis is credited with reinvigorating the city's iconic Beale Street.

We're thrilled to see you tonight, and we hope you enjoy the show."" The lights dimmed, and her band, Sonneux, started playing. Accompanied by violin, double bass, guitar and recorder, Thorpe began to sing a familiar folk melody – only there was something surprising about her tune. Though it sounded like she was singing in French, in fact, she was singing in another language entirely: Jèrriais, Jersey's native language. ""In Jersey, we call this a veil'ye,"" she explained during a mid-show break, handing me a bowl of bean crock, a traditional, hearty island stew. ""It's an evening of singing, music and storytelling, where people read, perform and share memories. Before radio and TV, a veil'ye was how people socialised. Every village had them. They were part of life. But the tradition died out, so we decided to bring them back. And of course, we couldn't do that without Jèrriais."" Jersey is the largest of the Channel Islands, an archipelago of six inhabited islands (and many more uninhabited ones) scattered over the English Channel, just over 14 miles from the French coast. Despite its proximity to France, it's actually a British Crown Dependency, and as such, the island has two official languages: English and French.

The island's native language, Jèrriais, served as a clandestine code during the Nazi occupation. Musician Jo Thorpe and her band, Sonneux, are leading efforts to revive the traditional Jèrriais cultural gathering known as a ""veil'ye.""

These evenings, once a central form of socialisation before radio and television, feature singing, music, and storytelling performed entirely in Jèrriais, a language that sounds akin to French but is distinct. Thorpe emphasizes that the revival of these cherished community events, which had largely died out, is inseparable from the preservation of Jèrriais. Jersey, the largest of the British Crown Dependency Channel Islands located near the French coast, maintains Jèrriais alongside its official languages of English and French, highlighting its unique linguistic heritage.","द्वितीय विश्व युद्ध के अस्सी साल बाद, जर्सी द्वीप पर ब्रिटिश युद्धकालीन इतिहास का एक अनूठा पहलू पुनर्जीवित किया जा रहा है। द्वीप की मूल भाषा, जर्सीआई (Jèrriais), नाजी कब्जे के दौरान एक गुप्त कूटभाषा के रूप में इस्तेमाल की गई थी। संगीतकार जो थोर्प (Jo Thorpe) और उनका बैंड, सॉन्यूक्स (Sonneux), पारंपरिक जर्सीआई सांस्कृतिक सभा ""वेल'ए"" (veil'ye) को पुनर्जीवित करने के प्रयासों का नेतृत्व कर रहे हैं।

However, this prestigious recognition has been described as a ""double-edged sword"" by Craig Chapman, chair of Bibury Parish Council, due to the overwhelming tourist influx.

Despite a local population of just 600, Bibury can attract up to 20,000 visitors on busy summer weekends, leading to severe congestion, blocked roads, and significant strain on the village's narrow B/C roads, single-lane bridge, and limited parking. Chapman highlighted that this popularity comes ""at a cost for locals,"" who often feel overrun by the sheer volume of tourists, particularly large coaches.

In an effort to manage the situation, restrictions were introduced in May, closing central parking bays and establishing new drop-off and pick-up points. Tourists have also been asked to use smaller vehicles when visiting. Chapman expressed the need for ""harmony"" between tourists and residents, hoping these measures will help mitigate the negative impacts while allowing the village to manage its newfound global fame.","कॉटस्वोल्ड्स (Cotswolds) में स्थित सुरम्य गाँव बिबरी (Bibury) को फोर्ब्स पत्रिका (Forbes Magazine) ने अपनी 2025 की सूची के लिए ""दुनिया का सबसे खूबसूरत गाँव"" घोषित किया है। हालाँकि, बिबरी पैरिश परिषद (Bibury Parish Council) के अध्यक्ष क्रेग चैपमैन (Craig Chapman) ने इस प्रतिष्ठित पहचान को पर्यटकों की भारी आमद के कारण ""दोधारी तलवार"" बताया है।

केवल 600 की स्थानीय आबादी होने के बावजूद, बिबरी व्यस्त गर्मी के सप्ताहांत में 20,000 तक आगंतुकों को आकर्षित कर सकता है। इससे गाँव की संकरी बी/सी सड़कों, एकल-लेन पुल और सीमित पार्किंग पर अत्यधिक भीड़, सड़कों के अवरुद्ध होने और भारी दबाव की स्थिति उत्पन्न होती है। चैपमैन ने इस बात पर जोर दिया कि यह लोकप्रियता ""स्थानीय लोगों को भारी कीमत पर मिलती है"", जो अक्सर पर्यटकों, खासकर बड़ी बसों (coaches) की अत्यधिक संख्या से अभिभूत महसूस करते हैं।

स्थिति को नियंत्रित करने के प्रयास में, मई में प्रतिबंध लगाए गए, जिसके तहत केंद्रीय पार्किंग स्थलों को बंद कर दिया गया और नए ड्रॉप-ऑफ (drop-off) और पिक-अप (pick-up) पॉइंट स्थापित किए गए। पर्यटकों से गाँव का दौरा करते समय छोटे वाहनों का उपयोग करने का भी अनुरोध किया गया है। चैपमैन ने पर्यटकों और निवासियों के बीच ""सामंजस्य"" की आवश्यकता व्यक्त की, उम्मीद जताते हुए कि ये उपाय नकारात्मक प्रभावों को कम करने में मदद करेंगे और साथ ही गाँव को अपनी नई वैश्विक प्रसिद्धि को सफलतापूर्वक प्रबंधित करने में सक्षम बनाएंगे।",en,[],,"The village has 600 residents but can have up to 20,000 tourists over a single summer weekend.",[''],www.bbc.com/travel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was inspired by the 20km (12.5 miles) Green Line project in Nantes in north west France, which connects the work of artists, architects, landscape designers and urban poets and takes people to artworks in the city. Mr Wakefield said the line had already helped people to discover landmarks they did not know about, such as the Titanic Memorial which commemorates the 14 people who had Guernsey connections and died when the liner sank. He said the walking line will also take people to Fountain Street and help them discover stories like the history of the fountain, which the street was named after, made by the sculptor who created the fountain at The Plantation and added: ""There are lots of little stories like that."" The idea has been four years in the making and Mr Wakefield said it was a ""low-tech project"" with printed guides available from the tourist information centre, as well as downloadable information. There are also plans for information in French. Mr Wakefield said work had been delayed in the quest to find paint which could be removed if it gets a thumbs down. However, he said when workers started painting it passers-by told him ""this is a really good idea"".

The low-tech concept, described by director Trevor Wakefield as ""a simple green line on the floor,"" aims to intrigue and guide people to discover local landmarks and hidden stories.

The current trial, which runs until December along the St Peter Port seafront, connects the Liberation Monument to the Victor Hugo Bench and is open to the public. Plans are to extend this route to 5km (3 miles), spanning from Hauteville House to Candie Gardens, with completion anticipated by the end of the year.

Wakefield noted the project took four years to develop, encountering delays in finding removable paint, but public reception has been overwhelmingly positive. Despite initial doubts from the organizers, passers-by have praised the idea, with the line already helping people discover previously unknown sites like the Titanic Memorial and local histories such as that of Fountain Street. Free printed guides are available, and multilingual information in English, French, and Spanish is planned.","**ग्वेर्नसे आर्ट्स ने सेंट पीटर पोर्ट में एक प्रायोगिक 'ग्रीन लाइन' परियोजना शुरू की है, जो फ्रांस के नैनटेस में इसी तरह की एक पहल से प्रेरित है। यह परियोजना कला, वास्तुकला और शहरी डिज़ाइन को जोड़ती है। निदेशक ट्रेवर वेकफ़ील्ड ने इसे ""फर्श पर एक साधारण हरी रेखा"" के रूप में वर्णित किया है। इस कम-तकनीकी अवधारणा का उद्देश्य लोगों में उत्सुकता जगाना और उन्हें स्थानीय स्थलों व छिपी हुई कहानियों को खोजने में मार्गदर्शन करना है।**

From my window seat on the three-hour flight from Buenos Aires to Comodoro Rivadavia, I watched the land shift from green to gold. Lush river delta gave way to straw-coloured steppe, eventually turning a vivid cobalt where high desert meets the sea. I was heading to Patagonia Azul, a newly declared provincial park on Argentina's South Atlantic coast. This is not the Patagonia of postcards. There are no snow-capped peaks, trout-filled lakes or gleaming glaciers. Instead, this protected territory stretches across more than three million hectares – nearly the size of Yosemite – where arid plains collapse into a rugged, wind-battered coast. Patagonia Azul is one of South America's most recent marine conservation efforts. More than 60 islands and islets rise from the Atlantic here, forming the most biodiverse stretch of Argentina's coastline. Long gravel roads cut through remote hills where guanacos graze and elusive pumas roam, while the sea harbours kelp forests, sea lion colonies, penguins, dolphins and four whale species. Just 200 nautical miles offshore lies the edge of Argentina's Exclusive Economic Zone, a boundary closely monitored but frequently breached by foreign industrial fishing fleets, drawn by the region's rich marine life.

Spindly pines stood in silhouette against a deepening sky. ""Stop. Listen. Breathe,"" Pehka said, pausing on a grassy tussock. I expected a bird call or the rustle of wind. There was only silence and a rich earthy smell perfumed with rosemary. She bent to pluck a sprig of greenery.

I was walking here in summer, when dragonflies skimmed the dark, mirror-like pools and cotton grass swayed above clumps of peat moss. ""In autumn the moss turns crimson,"" said Pehka. ""In winter the land sleeps under snow and ice, and in spring the bog breathes again with green shoots as cranes, storks and swallows begin to nest.""","Estonia's extensive bogs, covering a fifth of the country, are deeply intertwined with its culture, ecology, and national identity.

""The flow I've created for this evening is all about joy and cultivating as much of it as humanly possible,"" says yoga teacher Jess Symondson. The setting does feel ideal for fostering bliss. About 40 of us have gathered in a fairy-lit tipi overlooking a soft peach sunset and a field of heritage einkorn wheat on a regenerative farm. A DJ plays mellow, expansive music. We're about to do a dance-like series of poses before sipping rosé around a fire. ""That's what we're working toward. That's our North Star,"" she says with a laugh. Sunset Yoga, DJ & Rosé is one of the most popular offerings at Lopemede Farm in Oxfordshire. And it's part of a growing movement across the UK. As people seek reconnection with community and the land, and farmers face the economic imperative to diversify, many farms are becoming hubs of healing for locals, travellers and the natural world. They're hosting a variety of wellbeing events, from sound bath meditations to digital detox retreats to women's empowerment workshops. This trend counteracts the decades-long cliche that farmers are constantly trying to keep people off their land. ""We flipped that to 'get on our land',"" Eddie Rixon, who runs Lopemede Farm, said at the 2025 Oxford Real Farming Conference. ""We are welcoming people onto the land, and we are seeing the difference it's making to people's wellbeing."" From breakdown to breakthrough A fourth-generation farmer, Rixon never dreamed people would be doing cow pose on his cattle pasture. Then in 2017, everything his family had built came crashing down. Some of his cows failed a routine tuberculosis test, forcing him to sell the entire herd of 250 pedigree breeding cattle. A week later, his butcher shop burned down in an arson attack. The next day, he found a woman and her dog trampled to death by his cows. Shortly after, his beloved mother died.","Across the UK, farms are undergoing a significant transformation, evolving from traditional production sites into vibrant centres of healing and well-being. This growing movement sees farms offering diverse activities such as field yoga, sound baths in barns, and nature retreats, all designed to nurture both individuals and the land.

An exemplary offering is the popular ""Sunset Yoga, DJ & Rosé"" event at Lopemede Farm in Oxfordshire. Participants gather in idyllic settings, like a fairy-lit tipi overlooking heritage wheat fields, for joyful, dance-like yoga sessions, followed by community bonding over rosé around a fire. Yoga teacher Jess Symondson emphasizes cultivating joy, while farm owner Eddie Rixon refers to this welcoming approach as their ""North Star.""

This trend is a response to a dual need: a societal desire for reconnection with community and nature, and farmers' economic imperative to diversify their operations. It marks a profound shift from the traditional perception of farmers guarding their land, with many now actively inviting the public in. As Rixon stated at the Oxford Real Farming Conference, ""We flipped that to 'get on our land'.""

Rixon's own journey into this new farming model was born out of immense personal and professional adversity. In 2017, his fourth-generation farm faced a series of catastrophic events: the forced sale of his entire pedigree cattle herd due to a TB test, his butcher shop burning down in an arson attack, the tragic death of a woman and her dog trampled by his cows, and the subsequent death of his mother. These profound challenges led him to reimagine Lopemede Farm as a hub for well-being, demonstrating how crisis can spur innovative approaches to land stewardship and community engagement.","यहां अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद दिया गया है:

यह प्रवृत्ति एक दोहरी आवश्यकता के प्रति एक प्रतिक्रिया है: समुदाय और प्रकृति के साथ फिर से जुड़ने की सामाजिक इच्छा, और अपने कार्यों में विविधता लाने की किसानों की आर्थिक आवश्यकता। यह किसानों द्वारा अपनी भूमि की रखवाली करने की पारंपरिक धारणा से एक गहरा बदलाव है, जिसमें अब कई लोग जनता को सक्रिय रूप से आमंत्रित कर रहे हैं। जैसा कि रिक्सन ने ऑक्सफ़ोर्ड रियल फ़ार्मिंग कॉन्फ्रेंस में कहा था, ""हमने इसे 'हमारी ज़मीन पर आओ' में बदल दिया।""

रिक्सन की इस नए खेती मॉडल में अपनी यात्रा अत्यधिक व्यक्तिगत और पेशेवर विपरीत परिस्थितियों से उत्पन्न हुई थी। 2017 में, उनके चौथी पीढ़ी के फार्म को विनाशकारी घटनाओं की एक श्रृंखला का सामना करना पड़ा: टीबी परीक्षण के कारण उनके पूरे शुद्ध नस्ल के मवेशियों के झुंड की जबरन बिक्री, आगजनी के हमले में उनकी कसाई की दुकान का जल जाना, उनकी गायों द्वारा कुचले जाने से एक महिला और उसके कुत्ते की दुखद मौत, और बाद में उनकी माँ की मृत्यु। इन गहरी चुनौतियों ने उन्हें लोपमेड फार्म को कल्याण के केंद्र के रूप में फिर से कल्पना करने के लिए प्रेरित किया, यह दर्शाता है कि संकट कैसे भूमि प्रबंधन और सामुदायिक जुड़ाव के लिए नवीन दृष्टिकोणों को जन्म दे सकता है।",en,[],,"Facing financial and ecological pressures, UK farmers are diversifying into wellness, transforming barns, meadows and woodlands into unexpected sanctuaries.",[''],www.bbc.com/travel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, what makes this chocolate so controversial? It's started to drizzle across the marsh, but we're prepared – as we Norwegians say, ""there's no bad weather, only bad clothing"". We've just happened upon a patch of cloudberries, an elusive Arctic delicacy that thrives in wet bogs, noting their location so we can come back to pick them when they've ripened to orange. And as we huddle under the soft needles of a spruce tree, my friend digs into her pocket and pulls out something no Norwegian would ever leave behind on a trip into nature: a Kvikk Lunsj. Kvikk Lunsj is a four-fingered chocolate bar that's beloved across Norway and synonymous with outdoor exploration. The snack's slogan is ""tursjokoladen"" (""the trip chocolate""), and ads for the wafers often depict hikers spinning a compass, skiers summiting frosty peaks and people drinking water from rushing rivers. Today, roughly 60 million Kvikk Lunsj bars are produced each year – about 11 for every Norwegian – and whether you're skipping across mountain brooks or striking out in a kayak, no journey into the Norwegian wilderness is complete without one. That's because Kvikk Lunsj isn't just a sweet treat; it's part of our national heritage. Kvikk Lunsj was invented in 1937, but according to its creator Johan Throne Holst, the story actually starts 45 years earlier with a failed hike. Throne Holst, then a young businessman, wanted to show Norway's stunning landscapes to his German business associate, but they lost their way in the woods outside Oslo. As the pair trudged on, directionless and increasingly hungry, the German complained that their journey would have been salvaged had they packed some chocolate.","Kvikk Lunsj, a beloved four-fingered chocolate bar, is deeply embedded in Norwegian outdoor culture and national heritage. Known as 'the trip chocolate' ('tursjokoladen'), it has fueled generations of adventures, with its slogan and ads depicting hikers. Approximately 60 million bars are produced annually – about 11 per Norwegian – underscoring its status as an indispensable item for any journey into the wilderness.

The chocolate's origins date back to 1937, created by Johan Throne Holst. The inspiration struck 45 years earlier during a failed hike where Holst and a German business associate got lost and hungry near Oslo, with the German lamenting the absence of chocolate to salvage their expedition.","**क्विक्क लूंश: नॉर्वे की आउटडोर संस्कृति का अभिन्न अंग**

क्विक्क लूंश, एक पसंदीदा चार-उँगलियों वाला चॉकलेट बार, नॉर्वे की बाहरी संस्कृति (outdoor culture) और राष्ट्रीय धरोहर में गहराई से रचा-बसा है। इसे 'ट्रिप चॉकलेट' या 'यात्रा चॉकलेट' ('तूरशुकोलाडेन') के नाम से जाना जाता है। इसने पीढ़ियों के साहसिक अभियानों को ऊर्जा दी है, और इसके नारे व विज्ञापनों में अक्सर पैदल यात्रियों (hikers) को दर्शाया जाता है।

सालाना लगभग 6 करोड़ बार का उत्पादन होता है – यानी प्रत्येक नॉर्वेजियाई के लिए लगभग 11 बार – जो जंगल में किसी भी यात्रा के लिए इसकी अनिवार्य वस्तु की स्थिति को रेखांकित करता है।

इस चॉकलेट की उत्पत्ति 1937 में हुई थी, जिसे जोहान थ्रोन होल्स्ट ने बनाया था। इस प्रेरणा की जड़ें 45 साल पहले एक असफल पैदल यात्रा में हैं, जब होल्स्ट और उनके एक जर्मन व्यापार सहयोगी ओस्लो के पास रास्ता भटक गए और भूखे रह गए थे। उस वक्त जर्मन सहयोगी ने अपने अभियान को बचाने के लिए चॉकलेट की कमी पर खेद व्यक्त किया था।",en,[],,"Known as 'the trip chocolate', Kvikk Lunsj has fuelled outdoor adventures for generations.

The morning and evening departures allow for day trips or overnight journeys. However, I opted for a longer adventure, hopping on and off the train with two overnight stops in coastal Mississippi.

Just in time for Lollapalooza Chicago 2025, here are his favourite pies in the city. Outside Chicago, the term ""Chicago-style pizza"" is invariably associated with the deep-dish pie that's often mocked by out-of-towners as ""lasagna in a bread bowl"". But true Chicagoans know that the city and its suburbs are actually home to three iconic styles of pizza: deep-dish, stuffed and Chicago thin – AKA: ""tavern style"". As visitors prepare to flock to the city for the 25th edition of Lollapalooza, a massive annual four-day music festival expected to draw 100,000 people per day, they'll find plenty of opportunities to experience what is arguably Chicago's most famous culinary offering in all its forms. We tapped renowned local food reporter Steve Dolinsky for his expert take.

Singapore would return under British control after WW2, but as its grip loosened, the island gained self-governance in 1959 – a first step towards the full independence it would eventually gain in 1965.

1942 में सिंगापुर के पतन के ब्रिटिश साम्राज्य पर गहरे और दूरगामी परिणाम हुए। इसने भारत से ब्रिटिश वापसी को गति दी और इसे साम्राज्य के 'अंत की शुरुआत' माना गया। साथ ही, इसने ब्रिटेन के वैश्विक संबंधों को भी प्रभावित किया। हालांकि, द्वितीय विश्व युद्ध के बाद सिंगापुर ब्रिटिश नियंत्रण में लौट आया, लेकिन 1959 तक इसे स्वशासन मिल गया और 1965 में पूर्ण स्वतंत्रता प्राप्त हुई। इसके पहले प्रधान मंत्री, ली कुआन यू ने ब्रिटिश शासन के प्रति सम्मान में आई कमी को रेखांकित किया था।

आज, सिंगापुर इस महत्वपूर्ण अवधि को 50 से अधिक द्वितीय विश्व युद्ध स्थलों को समाहित करने वाले एक हेरिटेज ट्रेल (विरासत मार्ग) के माध्यम से याद करता है। मुख्य आकर्षणों में फोर्ट कैनिंग पार्क में स्थित बैटलबॉक्स शामिल है, जो ब्रिटिश कमान केंद्र था जहां 1942 में आत्मसमर्पण का निर्णय लिया गया था। यहां प्रतिकृतियों और मल्टीमीडिया प्रदर्शनियों के माध्यम से उस घटना को दर्शाया गया है। पूर्व फोर्ड फैक्ट्री, ब्रिटिशों के औपचारिक आत्मसमर्पण का स्थल, जापानी कब्जे की शुरुआत का प्रतीक है। इसमें सूख चिंग के बचे हुए लोगों के वृत्तांत और कब्जे के दौरान जीवन की कहानियाँ प्रदर्शित हैं। इसके अतिरिक्त, चांगी चैपल और संग्रहालय 90,000 से अधिक मित्र देशों के युद्धबंदियों (POWs) और नागरिकों को याद करता है, जिनमें मुख्य रूप से यूके, ऑस्ट्रेलिया और सिंगापुर के लोग शामिल थे। इन सभी ने 1942 से 1945 तक चांगी जेल में कठोर कारावास झेला था।",en,[],,"Britain's surrender of Singapore has long been viewed as a ""humiliation"".

Shortly afterwards, it was classified as a Natural and Cultural Reserve and taken under the protection of the renowned non-profit conservation organisation African Parks. And earlier this year, a long-term archaeological study began that will not only map all the rock art sites, but also investigate the surrounding ground for ancient ceramics, plant pollen and animal bones. ""When an Italian archaeologist recently came for a brief visit, he found, within half an hour, a 7,000-year-old piece of pottery,"" said my Italian guide, Andrea Bonomo, who works for the company Spazi d'Avventura, which has been running trips to Chad for 30 years. ""Imagine what they will find with more time."" Later, Bonomo explained how in 2001, a seven-million-year-old fossilised skull, nicknamed Toumaï, was discovered west of Ennedi. The remains were far older than Ethiopia's famous skeleton, ""Lucy"", leading some people to believe that Chad could be the origin of humanity, and not Ethiopia's Rift Valley. According to Dr Baba Mallaye, a team member involved in the discovery, not only has Toumaï's age been scientifically validated by radio chronological analysis, but the team also found many other fossilised remains of Toumaï's cousins in the same area, proving that this was not an isolated case. To reach Ennedi, Bonomo and I drove through savannah with desert roses, yellow grasses and acacia trees gleaming gold. We passed nomadic Wodaabe and Oulad-Rachid people on the move. Women and children rode up on camels, seated inside colourful chariots decorated with vivid fabrics, carved calabashes and rows of bronze bowls. Men walked alongside, leather amulets strapped across their chests like small suitcases to protect them from evil. Then the tarmac road stopped, the land emptied of trees and entering Ennedi was like stepping through a portal into a place between worlds. Ennedi's rock art reveals the changes that have happened over millennia to this land. Like the whole of the Sahara, the area was once green and glittered with lakes. Many people once lived here, but now few do. As I wandered among the red monoliths, I saw images of elephants, rhinos, giraffes and ostriches – all common wild animals in Ennedi until relevantly recently. After the area became drier more than 6,000 years ago, these animals either moved south or died out. Yet, Ennedi remains known as the Eden of the Sahara because it receives more rain than the rest of the desert, creating wadis like green ribbons and permanent water sources fed by crystal-clear springs. Tropical plants bloom and relics of its more temperate times survive, like its desert crocodiles.","The Ennedi region in Chad, a Switzerland-sized area, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2016 and is now a protected Natural and Cultural Reserve overseen by African Parks due to its immense biodiversity.

It holds significant archaeological importance, with a recently initiated long-term study mapping extensive rock art and investigating surrounding ground that has already yielded a 7,000-year-old piece of pottery, suggesting vast undiscovered potential. This builds on the 2001 discovery of Toumaï, a scientifically validated 7-million-year-old fossilised skull found nearby, which, being older than ""Lucy,"" has led some to propose Chad as a possible origin of humanity.

Ennedi's rock art vividly illustrates its ancient past when the Sahara was a green landscape with lakes and abundant megafauna like elephants and giraffes. These animals either migrated or died out as the region became significantly drier over 6,000 years ago, leading to a decline in human population.

Despite this environmental transformation, Ennedi is known as the ""Eden of the Sahara"" due to its unique microclimate receiving more rain, sustaining permanent wadis, crystal-clear springs, tropical plants, and relict species such as desert crocodiles. Accessing this remote yet culturally rich area involves traveling through savannas and encountering nomadic Wodaabe and Oulad-Rachid communities.","चाड का एनेडी क्षेत्र, जो स्विट्जरलैंड के आकार का है, 2016 में यूनेस्को विश्व धरोहर स्थल घोषित किया गया था। अपनी अपार जैव विविधता के कारण, यह अब अफ्रीकन पार्क्स द्वारा देखरेख किया जाने वाला एक संरक्षित प्राकृतिक और सांस्कृतिक आरक्षित क्षेत्र है।

यह पुरातात्विक रूप से भी अत्यधिक महत्वपूर्ण है। हाल ही में शुरू हुए एक दीर्घकालिक अध्ययन में यहाँ की व्यापक शैल कला (rock art) का मानचित्रण किया जा रहा है और आसपास की भूमि की भी जाँच की जा रही है, जिससे पहले ही 7,000 साल पुराना एक मिट्टी का बर्तन मिला है, जो विशाल अज्ञात क्षमता की ओर इशारा करता है। इसका महत्व पास में 2001 में तुम्हेई (Toumaï) की खोज से और बढ़ जाता है, जो एक वैज्ञानिक रूप से मान्य 70 लाख (7 मिलियन) साल पुरानी जीवाश्म खोपड़ी थी। 'लूसी' से भी पुरानी होने के कारण, इस खोज ने कुछ लोगों को चाड को मानवता का संभावित मूल स्थान मानने के लिए प्रेरित किया है।

एनेडी की शैल कला इसके प्राचीन अतीत को स्पष्ट रूप से दर्शाती है, जब सहारा झीलों और हाथियों व जिराफ जैसे प्रचुर विशालकाय जीवों (megafauna) के साथ एक हरा-भरा परिदृश्य था। 6,000 साल पहले यह क्षेत्र काफी शुष्क होने के कारण ये जानवर या तो पलायन कर गए या विलुप्त हो गए, जिससे मानवीय आबादी में भी गिरावट आई।

इस पर्यावरणीय परिवर्तन के बावजूद, एनेडी को ""सहारा का स्वर्ग"" (या ""सहारा का ईडन"") कहा जाता है। इसका कारण इसकी अनूठी सूक्ष्म जलवायु है जहाँ अधिक वर्षा होती है, जिससे यहाँ स्थायी वादी (सूखी नदी घाटियां), क्रिस्टल-साफ झरने, उष्णकटिबंधीय पौधे और मरुस्थलीय मगरमच्छ जैसी अवशेष प्रजातियाँ मौजूद हैं। इस दूरस्थ लेकिन सांस्कृतिक रूप से समृद्ध क्षेत्र तक पहुँचने के लिए सवाना से होकर यात्रा करनी पड़ती है और यहाँ खानाबदोश वोडाबे (Wodaabe) और औलाद-रशीद (Oulad-Rachid) समुदायों से भी मिलना होता है।",en,[],,"It contains one of the world's largest concentrations of prehistoric art, yet is barely known to the rest of the world.",[''],www.bbc.com/travel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mexico City's status as one of the world's top culinary capitals is often credited to the creative tasting menus and celebrity chef collaborations found in its upscale Roma Norte neighbourhood. But the flavours served on those affluent, tree-lined streets often begin their journey to the plate at dawn – in a sprawling, chaotic market in one of the city's poorest boroughs. Located in Iztapalapa, Central de Abasto is the largest wholesale market in the world, covering 3.27 sq km – roughly the size of New York City's Central Park – and supplying 80% of the capital's produce. Between 04:00 and 08:00, the sprawl feels like a scene from Blade Runner, with buyers elbowing their way through narrow paths to haggle at thousands of warehouses and slapdash produce stalls. Diableros (hand-truck porters) sprint through the maze of crowds and beeping trucks, careful not to bump into colleagues balancing wooden crates on their heads. Whenever I hear a trilling whistle, I jump aside to let a ""little devil"" race past with a comically overloaded bundle. Central de Abasto opened in 1982 to replace La Merced, CDMX's colonial-era trading centre. Every day, it welcomes half a million visitors and handles more than 30,000 tons of produce from across Mexico. The ramshackle vibe is characteristic of Iztapalapa, historically derided as a ""trash district"" for its landfills and prisons. Today, 43% of its two million residents live in moderate to extreme poverty, making it one of the capital's poorest boroughs. Yet Central's pivotal role in feeding the capital's world-class restaurants is shifting perceptions. Although home shoppers also visit, Central's focus is on large-scale buying – with supersized displays to match. I gawk at a wall of watermelons piled higher than my head and a giant stacks of carrots. I smell the garlic shop before I see it: it has boxes of bulbs stacked to the ceiling, braids dangling from the rafters. Then, I follow my nose to a vendor hawking juicy tacos campechanos (grilled beef and sausage with cactus, potatoes and pico de gallo). The sheer variety of the mercado's selection reflects Mexico's multitudes of microclimates, and vendors come from all over the region to sell uniquely Mexican produce. Rey Lopez Central de Abasto supplies nearly 80% of Mexico City's food (Credit: Rey Lopez) Chefs have long bought staples at Central de Abasto, but over the past 10 to 15 years a new wave of fine-dining pioneers began coming not just for bulk produce, but for rarer, organic and indigenous ingredients. Farmers like Alfredo Cruz Camacho illustrate the shift. At one of the market's many long tables, he proudly displays candy cane beetroot with red and white inner rings and glossy baby heirloom tomatoes. His specialty crops caught the attention of Michelin-starred chefs browsing the stalls, including Israel Montero of Siembra Comedor. ""He invited me to his restaurant in [the upscale neighbourhood of] Polanco, an area unknown to me as I only lived off the chinampas in Tláhuac [floating farms pioneered by the Aztecs],"" Camacho recalls.","Mexico City's Central de Abasto, the world's largest wholesale market, has emerged as the unexpected cornerstone of the city's acclaimed fine-dining revolution.

Does that happen often? I think it depends what's happening in my life, but the truth is that I'm a founder and CEO of a big, huge beauty company. There's no off time. This is my big, beautiful life so I don't find it to be a burden. I do answer texts more slowly when I'm on vacation. I don’t have my phone with me every move I make. And I sometimes day drink. [laughs] So if you day drink, you can't be on that phone working! What are the first things you do in a new place? I settle in. I like to unpack; I'm an unpack girl. I also like to take a bath, because I feel like it settles my body off the plane, and I now actually have my feet on the ground. I love to look for a lymphatic drainage massage. How do you plan your trip? Usually, I have researched in advance if there's a particular restaurant I want to try or if there's a gallery or a museum that I want to visit so that I'm not spending my time researching. My favourite thing to do is find those places by asking [local] people versus TikTok, you know? Because I lived in Europe growing up and went to school in Europe, I know people and I can usually collect a really good sort of itinerary for myself. What's one thing you never do? I don't overbook. If I go on a trip, it might be like one restaurant that I try. I don't like to jam pack my days in any way, shape or form. You don’t want to need a vacation from the vacation. I come home from my solo trips and I'm, like, ready to jive back into my life. Courtesy of The Roku Channel Ross never overbooks her solo trips to make sure she comes back to real life refreshed (Credit: Courtesy of The Roku Channel) There are some great scenes of you celebrating local food culture in the series. I try to keep it simple and order things that I know and love. [But in] Morocco, my mouth was so happy and I had no idea what I was eating. [There] were flavours that my mouth had never tasted! And it was delicious! I was, like, 'I don't even know what these things are!' So I love that part of it. And then you just wanna have some fries. What's the best way to experience a city on your own? I listen to the sounds. I find it so soothing to listen to the sounds of an environment, because they sound different everywhere. Wind sounds different. The birds sound different. The traffic sounds different. So I do a lot of listening when I'm travelling. One of my favourite sounds in the world is wind on trees. Truly, it's just magic to me. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

In France, terroir is more than a word; it's a way of seeing the world. Long associated with wine, the concept that geography, climate, soil and human skill shape flavour is just as true for another French icon: cheese. And while the French have always known this, a growing number of travellers are discovering the country – and its culture – one wheel at a time. Last spring, Paris opened the Musée Vivant du Fromage, joining dozens of attractions across the country dedicated to cheese, from ageing caves and cheese museums to visitor centres and tasting tours. There are regional Route de Fromage trails to follow, producers to meet and pastures to walk through – each offering a deeper understanding of how place shapes flavour. The appetite for food-focussed travel is only set to grow: Future Market Insights predicts that the market for culinary experiences in France will rise by nearly 16% over the next decade. The new museum, a short stroll from the newly restored Notre-Dame Cathedral, is small but rich in scope. Exhibits in both English and French explain how cheeses are made, the people and traditions behind them and the science of ageing and flavour. Interactive screens encourage deeper exploration, while the shop counter offers a veritable ""Tour de France"" of cheeses. It all unfolds to an atmospheric soundtrack of cowbells, as if the meadows themselves were just outside. Museum manager Guillaume Gaubert says the trend started with the French themselves. ""We've noticed that a section of the population is less interested these days in going to the Bahamas, for example, and more inclined to take nature-based holidays in France, to discover the local terroirs,"" he explained. ""The French are really attached to their land. The cheese connects them to their terroir – so the Alsatian wants his Munster, the Norman his Camembert, the Basque his Ossau-Iraty. And the Savoyard? His Beaufort.""","France is experiencing a burgeoning trend in 'cheese tourism,' where travellers use the country's diverse array of cheeses as a unique guide through its landscapes, traditions, and history. The deep-rooted French concept of 'terroir'—encompassing geography, climate, soil, and human skill—is increasingly being applied to cheese, much like wine, to explain how place shapes flavour.

A growing number of visitors, and increasingly the French themselves, are discovering the country one cheese wheel at a time. This trend is bolstered by new attractions like Paris's recently opened Musée Vivant du Fromage, located near Notre-Dame. This small but rich museum, housed in a former munitions factory, features English and French exhibits detailing cheesemaking, its cultural heritage, and the science of ageing, all set to an atmospheric soundtrack of cowbells. Its shop offers a ""Tour de France"" of cheeses.

Beyond the museum, France boasts dozens of other cheese-focused attractions, including regional Route de Fromage trails, producer visits, and pasture walks, all offering deeper cultural insights. This culinary tourism market is projected to grow by nearly 16% in France over the next decade.

The surge in interest is partly driven by a renewed sense of national pride among the French, who are shifting towards nature-based domestic holidays to discover local terroirs. As locals identify strongly with their regional cheeses—like the Alsatian with Munster, the Norman with Camembert, or the Savoyard with Beaufort—cheese has become a powerful connector to their land and heritage.","**फ्रांस में 'चीज़ पर्यटन' का बढ़ता रुझान**

आगंतुकों की बढ़ती संख्या, और अब स्वयं फ्रांसीसी लोग भी, एक बार में चीज़ के एक-एक पहिये के माध्यम से अपने देश की खोज कर रहे हैं। इस प्रवृत्ति को पेरिस के हाल ही में खुले म्यूज़े विवांत डू फ्रॉमैज (Musée Vivant du Fromage) जैसे नए आकर्षणों से बल मिला है, जो नोट्रे-डेम के पास स्थित है। यह छोटा लेकिन समृद्ध संग्रहालय, जो एक पूर्व गोला-बारूद कारखाने में स्थित है, इसमें चीज़ बनाने की प्रक्रिया, इसकी सांस्कृतिक विरासत और चीज़ के पुराने होने के विज्ञान का विवरण देने वाली अंग्रेजी और फ्रेंच में प्रदर्शनियाँ हैं, यह सब गायों की घंटियों की वातावरणीय ध्वनि के साथ प्रस्तुत किया गया है। इसकी दुकान चीज़ों का एक ""टूर डी फ्रांस"" (Tour de France) प्रदान करती है।

संग्रहालय के अलावा, फ्रांस में दर्जनों अन्य चीज़-केंद्रित आकर्षण हैं, जिनमें क्षेत्रीय 'रूट डी फ्रॉमैज' (Route de Fromage) ट्रेल्स, उत्पादक दौरे और चरागाह की सैर शामिल हैं, ये सभी गहरी सांस्कृतिक अंतर्दृष्टि प्रदान करते हैं। अनुमान है कि अगले दशक में फ्रांस में यह पाक-कला पर्यटन बाज़ार लगभग 16% बढ़ेगा।

रुचि में यह उछाल आंशिक रूप से फ्रांसीसियों के बीच राष्ट्रीय गौरव की एक नई भावना से प्रेरित है, जो स्थानीय 'टेरॉइर' की खोज के लिए प्रकृति-आधारित घरेलू छुट्टियों की ओर बढ़ रहे हैं। चूंकि स्थानीय लोग अपनी क्षेत्रीय चीज़ों से दृढ़ता से जुड़े हुए हैं – जैसे एल्साशियन मुन्स्टर (Munster) से, नॉर्मन कैमेम्बर्ट (Camembert) से, या सवोयार्ड ब्यूफोर्ट (Beaufort) से – चीज़ उनकी भूमि और विरासत से जुड़ने का एक शक्तिशाली माध्यम बन गया है।",en,[],,"From Alpine caves to Corsica's mountains, travellers are discovering France's landscapes and traditions through its most famous dairy delicacy.",[''],www.bbc.com/travel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four hours north of Lima, the ochre slopes of the Supe Valley seem inhospitable: windswept plains, crumbled adobe walls and the shimmer of heat rising from the desert. It's hard to imagine that these dry slopes once supported one of the world's first great civilisations – and that, once-buried beneath this desert, a new discovery is rewriting the history of the Americas. In July 2025, Peruvian archaeologist Dr Ruth Shady unveiled Peñico, a 3,800 year-old city of Peru's ancient Caral civilisation. The newly excavated site features 18 structures, including ceremonial temples and residential compounds. Most importantly, it provides fresh evidence that the Caral people adapted to climate disaster without turning to war – a survival strategy that feels as extraordinary today as it must have been millennia ago. ""Peñico continues the Caral civilisation's vision of life without conflicts,"" said Shady, who has led research in the valley for three decades. The peaceful cradle of the Americas Long before the Aztec, Maya or Inca, Peru's arid coast was home to the Caral, one of the world's most ancient and peaceful societies.

I already felt that Perth was a little like that – at least, life there felt slower and less frenzied than in my hometown of Melbourne on Australia's east coast – but I smiled back, not really knowing what she meant. However, she was right. Rottnest Island, a peaceful 19-sq-km isle off the coast of Western Australia, is, in fact, magical. The spell was cast as soon as our ferry left the mainland, skimming over the Indian Ocean. Humpback whales breached nearby, sending jets of sea spray into the air and flipping their tails as if in welcome. The sky was clear with the promise of a perfect day to come. Just 19km and 30 minutes later, I stepped off the ferry into another world. Rottnest Island has been famously car-free since 1931, and those more in the know than me immediately jumped onto bikes they'd brought with them or wandered off to hire one from Pedal and Flipper, said to be the largest bike hire place in the southern hemisphere.","Rottnest Island, a peaceful 19-square-kilometer isle located 19km off the coast of Western Australia, has gained global recognition, particularly for being home to the world's largest population of quokkas and other endangered species.

Visitors describe Rottnest as a ""magical"" destination where life slows down and a sense of calm prevails. The transformation begins with a mere 30-minute ferry journey from the mainland, which can even include sightings of breaching humpback whales. Once on the island, guests step into a different world. Notably, Rottnest Island has been car-free since 1931, promoting a serene environment.

Still, the two 25-year-olds realise that not everyone shares this sentiment. While hitchhiking was once commonplace around the world, it was later stigmatised as unsafe in the US and parts of Europe. And while it's a cheap way to travel, it's also a freedom few can afford. For many people around the world in remote, rural areas, hitchhiking isn't a choice; it's a lifeline – the only way to reach work, school or the next town where buses are scarce. But for young travellers like Menz, Endlicher and a new generation of adventure-seekers who have time, safety nets and passports that open borders, hitchhiking offers a budget‑friendly, eco-conscious way to move through the world, meeting strangers along the way. The history of hitchhiking Hitchhiking's roots stretch back to the early 20th Century. By the 1930s, hitchhiking in the US wasn't just mainstream, but necessary, as high unemployment during the Great Depression forced many Americans to hitch rides and travel long distances in cars or freight trains in search of scarcely available jobs. When World War Two began, hitchhiking became a patriotic duty to conserve resources for the war effort, as seen in an antique US poster stating: ""If you ride alone, you ride with Hitler."" But by the 1950s, fear took hold. The FBI branded hitchhiking a ""menace"", with director J. Edgar Hoover framing it as a safety and national security risk, as he believed that undercover agents could use it to slip through the country undetected. According to Jack Reid, author of the book Roadside Americans, which traces the practice's history in the US, Hoover instilled a campaign of fear in the US consciousness that largely still remains. A few decades later, coverage of high-profile crimes from US serial killer Edmund Kemper and Australian ""backpacker killer"" Ivan Milat – both of whom selected victims by offering rides to hitchhikers – cemented its dangerous reputation.","Hitchhiking, a travel method with deep historical roots, is experiencing a nuanced resurgence. While some proponents champion it as a ""way of life"" and a future-forward, eco-conscious option for adventurous travelers, its public perception remains divided. For many in remote rural areas, however, it is not a choice but a necessary lifeline for transport.

Historically, hitchhiking was commonplace, even becoming a necessity during the Great Depression and a patriotic duty during World War Two. However, by the mid-20th century, it became heavily stigmatized as unsafe in the U.S. and parts of Europe. This shift was largely driven by FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, who branded it a ""menace"" and a national security risk, fostering a lasting culture of fear. High-profile crimes by serial killers like Edmund Kemper and Ivan Milat further solidified its dangerous reputation, a perception that largely endures today despite its potential benefits for a new generation of travelers.","**हिचहाइकिंग (लिफ्ट लेकर यात्रा करना), जिसकी ऐतिहासिक जड़ें बहुत गहरी हैं, अब एक जटिल पुनरुत्थान देख रही है। जहाँ कुछ इसके समर्थक इसे एक 'जीवन शैली' और साहसी यात्रियों के लिए एक भविष्योन्मुखी, पर्यावरण-सचेत विकल्प के रूप में देखते हैं, वहीं इसकी सार्वजनिक धारणा अभी भी विभाजित है। हालाँकि, दूरदराज के कई ग्रामीण क्षेत्रों में, यह एक पसंद नहीं बल्कि परिवहन के लिए एक आवश्यक जीवनरेखा है।**

If you're after a city break that combines culture, comfort and quiet innovation, Oslo might surprise you. Barely a two-hour flight from Heathrow, the Norwegian capital offers something unexpected: a relaxed, walkable escape where everyday life is designed for ease, from all-electric transport to sustainable neighbourhoods. In short, the perfect city for me to explore on my daylong layover. I started my 24-hour Oslo immersion in the pocket-sized Vulkan neighbourhood, a once-derelict industrial site that has become one of Europe's most forward-thinking micro-communities. Set on the banks of the Akerselva river, Vulkan is packed with art, culture and delicious food – something of a microcosm of Oslo itself. As soon as I arrived, the main square buzzed with friends catching up over coffee, people enjoying a mid-afternoon stroll and vendors hustling provisions through the streets in preparation for the dinner rush. Ringed by a food hall, a concert venue, a climbing gym and a dance theatre, Vulkan felt like a city within a city. Vulkan wasn't always this welcoming. Just 20 years ago, this riverside plot in central Oslo was a derelict tangle of concrete and broken windows. Today, it's a compact urban village powered by geothermal energy, cooled with rooftop solar panels and home to community-driven cultural spaces. Designed with a focus on density, design and sustainability, Vulkan is a model for how cities can rethink old spaces to create new futures. And, as I'd learn over 24 hours, it's also a gateway to understanding the quiet innovation at the heart of Norway's capital – a place where liveability is taken seriously.","Oslo is emerging as Europe's most liveable city, offering a sustainable, stylish, and relaxed city break experience, ideal for families and short layovers. Its appeal stems from all-electric transport, walkable neighborhoods, and a focus on ""quiet innovation"" that prioritizes comfort and culture.

The Vulkan neighborhood serves as a prime example of this transformation. Once a derelict industrial site, Vulkan has been revitalized into a forward-thinking, sustainable ""micro-community"" or ""city within a city"" along the Akerselva river. This buzzing area now features a vibrant main square, popular bars and restaurants, and diverse cultural spaces including a food hall, concert venue, climbing gym, and dance theatre. Powered by geothermal energy and cooled with rooftop solar panels, Vulkan is a model for urban renewal, demonstrating how old spaces can be reimagined for modern, sustainable, and community-driven futures, embodying Oslo's commitment to liveability and innovation.","**ओस्लो: यूरोप का सबसे रहने योग्य शहर, टिकाऊ और आरामदायक शहरी अनुभव का केंद्र**

It was just past noon in Mareterra, Monaco's newest neighbourhood, and a crowd swelled on the terrace outside Marlow, the principality's first British fine-dining restaurant. Nearby, office workers stretched out on wide steps by the water for their lunch break. Promenade Prince Jacques, the 800m pedestrian walkway that sweeps around the sea-facing perimeter of Mareterra, was busy with parents pushing strollers and joggers pounding the concrete pavement. I paused to soak up the view across the expanse of blue sea towards the leafy Roquebrune-Cap-Martin headland and Italy beyond. The area blended so seamlessly with the surrounding landscape that I struggled to remember how, six months ago, this was still an unfinished construction site – and that eight years ago, where I stood was the Mediterranean Sea. This reclaimed district, a €2bn project unveiled in December 2024, is Monaco's latest answer to a question it has faced for more than 150 years: how do you expand when you've already run out of land? I walked along the promenade and ducked through a door along the path, entering a dark, concrete antechamber. Another door led through to the hollowed interior of one of 18 caissons, the 10,000 ton, 26m-high chambers that sit side by side like giant Lego bricks on the seafloor to create the maritime infrastructure of the new neighbourhood. In the dark, unlit space, it took a while for my eyes to catch up to what my ears immediately recognised: waves, crashing against a wall then flopping back onto the water's surface. I peered over a thick railing separating me from the drop into the sea below. The Mediterranean surged up as if reaching for my attention, while the reinforced concrete chamber remained silent and immobile as it soaked up the impact of the swell.","Monaco has unveiled Mareterra, a new €2 billion district built on reclaimed land, designed to address the principality's long-standing challenge of land scarcity.

When Sheryl Murdock walks to her apartment in Culdesac – the US' first modern car-free neighbourhood built from scratch – she feels transported to a Mediterranean island. As she enters the central plaza, which serves as an al fresco communal living room, the blare of traffic fades, replaced by the clink of glasses, the hum of conversation and the thump of a cornhole game. She meanders down narrow pathways between low-slung white buildings crisscrossed with fairy lights, passing pops of colour from cheerful murals and magenta bougainvillea. Although she's in Arizona, Murdock says, ""It's like being in Greece."" Architect Daniel Parolek did have the Mediterranean in mind when he designed Culdesac, though he was influenced more by his travels to the hill towns and coastal villages of Italy and France. Travellers and locals love these settings, Parolek says, because ""these are places that were built prior to the automobile, so they were designed around accommodating people"". Why then, he asks, do people have to vacation to places like these rather than living in them? The answer is that societies made a Faustian deal with the automobile. As urban planners calibrated the built environment to the needs of cars rather than people, cities spread out into vast systems of traffic-clogged asphalt that disgorge solo commuters into soul-crushingly monotonous suburbs. Car-centric design has contributed to making metropolises more polluted, more socially isolating, less sustainable and hot as hell. But the collective consciousness is shifting. Research is revealing that walkable cities make people happier, less lonely, more satisfied with life and physically healthier. Movements are afoot around the globe toward sustainable urbanism, slow travel and 15-minute (or less) cities – such as Nordhavn in Copenhagen and superblocks in Barcelona. For travellers, strolling around Culdesac's shops, restaurants and outdoor markets offers a glimpse into a future where cities are once again built for people, not traffic.","Culdesac, located in Tempe, Arizona, is showcased as the United States' first modern car-free neighborhood built from scratch, reimagining urban living by prioritizing people over automobiles.

You go in to work on a Monday morning to find your colleagues gleefully discussing their plans for the upcoming long weekend – the long weekend you completely forgot was coming up. You're desperately in need of a break, but it seems too late to make plans now…. or is it? No need to settle for another weekend in your pyjamas watching The White Lotus for the seventh time. While planning ahead – ideally two weeks or more – is best in terms of both cost and availability, it's still possible to organise a reasonably priced holiday with less than a week's notice. Here are some expert tips on how to do it. Flexibility is key Flights are usually the hardest (and priciest) aspect of a super last-minute trip. ""Airlines tend to increase fares as the flight approaches,"" said Rachel Mumford, UK travel expert at KAYAK. ""So, while booking flights as early as possible is typically the best way to secure deals, that's not always possible."" Mumford and other experts stressed that flexibility is the key to overcoming this hurdle. ""For travellers booking within the week, flexibility is your superpower,"" Jesse Neugarten, founder and CEO of Dollar Flight Club, told the BBC. ""When you're planning a trip just days in advance, the more flexible you are on dates, times and even destinations, the more likely you are to score a great deal."" Getty Images Flights can be the most expensive element of a last minute trip, but flexibility on when, where and how you travel can help (Credit: Getty Images) You can also look for a package: ""Pick a destination that is easy to get to and offers plenty of experiences that can be arranged on short notice,"" suggested Tania Humana, director of sales at Banyan Tree Mayakob in the Riviera Maya. ""Looking for packages that combine accommodation and activities will help you get the most out of your trip.""","It is possible to secure affordable last-minute holidays even with less than a week's notice, offering a solution for those who realize a long weekend is approaching without plans. While booking trips weeks in advance generally offers the best deals, experts emphasize that **flexibility is the key** for spontaneous travelers.

This means being adaptable with travel dates, times, and even destinations, especially concerning flights, which are typically the most expensive and difficult aspect of last-minute trips due to increasing fares closer to departure. Experts advise that a flexible approach helps overcome this hurdle, allowing travelers to score better deals. Additionally, choosing easily accessible destinations and looking for travel packages that combine accommodation and activities can further enhance the value of a spontaneous getaway.","एक सप्ताह से भी कम समय की सूचना पर भी सस्ती अंतिम-मिनट की छुट्टियाँ बुक करना संभव है, जो उन लोगों के लिए एक समाधान प्रदान करता है जिन्हें यह एहसास होता है कि बिना किसी योजना के एक लंबा सप्ताहांत आ रहा है। जबकि यात्राओं को हफ्तों पहले बुक करने से आमतौर पर सबसे अच्छे सौदे मिलते हैं, विशेषज्ञ इस बात पर जोर देते हैं कि अचानक यात्रा करने वाले लोगों के लिए **लचीलापन ही कुंजी है**।

""The comprehensive data that we were able to present, including surveys of residents statewide, actuarial analysis of the potential impacts of climate events and extensive engagement with experts across the climate resilience spectrum, resulted in a favourable public opinion of a climate fee,"" says CAT chair Chris Benjamin.

Maho Tanaka, a Japanese advertising professional based in Tokyo who hopes to visit Hawaii in the next year, says she supports the state's new climate fee. ""It depends on how much it is,"" she says. ""If it were too expensive, especially with the weak yen, it might discourage me. But if it's just 0.75%, like an extra $3 on a $400 stay, then that seems fine."" While Tanaka doesn't actively track how such fees are used, she says their overall purpose matters. ""If it's going toward protecting Hawaii's beaches and forests, then that's a good thing… It feels [like] a contribution to something important. Hawaii is like one big national park. It makes sense to support it."" Alamy Surveys suggest most travellers are willing to pay climate-related visitor taxes if their uses are clearly communicated (Credit: Alamy) Zixuan Liu, a Chinese national, recently spent three weeks travelling around Greece after the nation implemented its new Climate Crisis Resilience Fee and echoes the survey's findings: ""I did notice the charge and thought it was a bit expensive, but I wasn't sure how it was being used. If that were made clearer, I'd actually be happy to pay more – as long as the money is going to the right place."" Still, experts warn that sustainability shouldn't be treated as an add-on. ""We need to bake sustainability into our operations, services and offerings so that travellers choose it by default,"" says Christopher Imbsen, Vice President of Research and Sustainability at the World Travel & Tourism Council. ""It shouldn't be a premium or an added layer of complexity. If sustainability is embedded from the start, people won't need to consciously choose it – it will simply be the obvious choice.""","Hawaii is developing new tourist taxes and is working to clarify how these funds, intended for climate resilience, will be used. Following the Lahaina fires, a Climate Advisory Team (CAT) was established, publishing a 60-page report on resilience efforts. CAT chair Chris Benjamin noted favorable public opinion for these initiatives due to comprehensive data and resident surveys.

Crucially, various studies indicate strong visitor support for contributing to sustainable travel. Booking.com's 2024 report found 75% of global travelers desire more sustainable options, with 71% hoping to leave destinations better than they found them. A 2023 Euromonitor study showed nearly 80% of visitors would pay at least 10% more for sustainable choices.

Visitors like Maho Tanaka, a Japanese advertising professional, support the fees if their purpose, such as protecting Hawaii's natural resources, is clear, viewing it as a contribution to something important. While acknowledging concerns about potential high costs due to factors like the weak yen, a small fee (e.g., $3 on a $400 stay) is generally acceptable if the usage is transparent. The Governor of Hawaii also supports the idea, likening the state to a vast national park that deserves support.

However, experts, including Christopher Imbsen of the World Travel & Tourism Council, warn that sustainability should not be an ""add-on"" or a premium. Instead, it must be ""baked into"" operations, services, and offerings to become the default and obvious choice for travelers, rather than an extra layer of complexity.","यहाँ अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

Here's how this South Pacific nation is preserving their paradise for generations for come. Landing on Rarotonga, the largest of the Cook Islands chain felt like stepping back in time. Gazing out of the taxi from Rarotonga airport to our resort, we were immediately struck by the absence of high-rise hotels, fast-food restaurants and corporate chains. There were no traffic lights, only coconut palms lining the road, the scent of salt and frangipani drifting through the air and the jungle meeting the ocean in a seamless panorama. It felt like Hawaii in the 1960s: uncrowded, laid-back and refreshingly authentic. Our taxi driver pointed to a low-slung resort along the shoreline. ""No building can be higher than a coconut tree,"" she said. This isn't just a local tradition but a law set in 1965 by the Cook Islands' first premier, Albert Henry, to prevent overdevelopment. She explained that only Cook Islanders can own land, ensuring that large corporations don't dominate the landscape. We looked out onto hotels blending naturally into their surroundings and white-sand beaches ringed with long green parks, all free from litter and crowds. We soon learned that this preservation of paradise is deeply intentional. Cook Islanders have made a conscious effort to ensure that Rarotonga never follows the path of overdevelopment seen in places like Honolulu. Instead, locals have committed to conservation, low-impact tourism and sustainable practices that benefit both locals and visitors. ""People come here because it is a paradise uncluttered by overdevelopment,"" explained Jeremy Goodwin, regenerative tourism manager for the Cook Islands Tourism Corporation (CITC). ""Our sacred duty as custodians of the land is to look after our paradise.""","The Cook Islands stands as a global model for sustainable tourism, intentionally preserving its pristine natural environment and cultural heritage despite attracting a significant number of visitors. This commitment is evident in strict regulations, such as a 1965 law prohibiting any building from exceeding the height of a coconut tree, and a policy reserving land ownership exclusively for Cook Islanders to prevent corporate overdevelopment.

The result is an unspoiled landscape, particularly on Rarotonga, where visitors experience an authentic, uncrowded atmosphere reminiscent of Hawaii in the 1960s, free from high-rise hotels, fast-food chains, and traffic lights. Locals have made a conscious effort to avoid the overdevelopment seen in other tourist destinations, prioritizing conservation and low-impact tourism. Cook Islanders view the protection of their ""paradise uncluttered by overdevelopment"" as a ""sacred duty,"" ensuring its preservation for future generations.","कुक आइलैंड्स स्थायी पर्यटन के लिए एक वैश्विक मॉडल के रूप में खड़ा है, जो बड़ी संख्या में आगंतुकों को आकर्षित करने के बावजूद जानबूझकर अपने प्राचीन प्राकृतिक पर्यावरण और सांस्कृतिक विरासत का संरक्षण करता है। यह प्रतिबद्धता कड़े नियमों में स्पष्ट है, जैसे कि 1965 का एक कानून जो किसी भी इमारत को नारियल के पेड़ की ऊंचाई से अधिक होने से रोकता है, और कॉर्पोरेट अति-विकास को रोकने के लिए कुक आइलैंडर्स के लिए विशेष रूप से भूमि स्वामित्व आरक्षित करने की नीति।

इंग्लैंड के समरसेट में स्थित एक छोटा-सा शहर, ग्लैस्टनबरी, अपने विशाल वार्षिक संगीत और प्रदर्शन कला महोत्सव के लिए विश्व स्तर पर प्रसिद्ध है। हालाँकि, इसका आध्यात्मिक और सांस्कृतिक महत्व कहीं अधिक प्राचीन और गहरा है; यह सदियों पुराने आध्यात्मिक चुम्बक के रूप में कार्य करता रहा है, जो आर्थरियन किंवदंतियों में डूबा हुआ है, जिसमें जोसेफ ऑफ एरिमाथिया और पवित्र ग्रेल से जुड़ी मान्यताएँ शामिल हैं, और यह अंग्रेजी ""नव-मूर्तिपूजकता"" (Neo-Paganism) का केंद्र भी है।

ग्लैस्टनबरी के आधुनिक आध्यात्मिक पुनरुत्थान में स्टोनहेंज और ब्रिटेन के आर्कड्रुइड रोलो मॉफ्लिंग की महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका है। मॉफ्लिंग, जिन्होंने 1960 के दशक में मूल ग्लैस्टनबरी महोत्सव की स्थापना में मदद की थी, उन्होंने आधुनिक द्रुइड्री (Druidry) के एक समावेशी रूप को विकसित करने में दशकों समर्पित किए हैं। उनका प्रभाव 1989 में ब्रिटिश द्रुइड आदेश परिषद (Council of British Druid Orders) की स्थापना में भी रहा, जिसने विशेष रूप से 2000 में स्टोनहेंज तक सार्वजनिक पहुंच सुनिश्चित की। मॉफ्लिंग ग्लैस्टनबरी और स्टोनहेंज दोनों में नियमित रूप से द्रुइडिक अनुष्ठान करते हैं। वे ग्लैस्टनबरी के समृद्ध आध्यात्मिक पक्ष का अनुभव करने पर मार्गदर्शन प्रदान करते हैं, और आगंतुकों को प्रसिद्ध पांच दिवसीय संगीत महोत्सव से परे इसके पवित्र स्थलों और मूर्तिपूजक वस्तुओं (Pagan wares) को खोजने के लिए प्रोत्साहित करते हैं।",en,[],,"Rollo Maughfling helped pioneer Glastonbury's modern Druidic revival.

It was a day Villa wrote a new page in their history books - an entry of the unwanted kind - as this is the first time they have failed to score in the opening four league games of any season. And, as the old saying goes, they were lucky to get nil from a scrappy goalless draw at Everton in which they were strictly second best. David Moyes' team made all the running at this magnificent Hill Dickinson Stadium, leaving Emery grateful not just for the excellence of his returning, rehabilitated goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, but also that Beto was the blunt instrument at the point of Everton's attack. The striker miskicked haplessly in front of an open goal when played in by Iliman Ndiaye in the opening minutes, then failed to make proper contact with another inviting cross at point-blank range in the second half. It meant Villa escaped with a point, Martinez saving superbly from Michael Keane's second-half header, but very little else in this display would have pleased Emery, despite his positive post-match messaging. The only moment to excite Villa's fans came in the second half when Emiliano Buendia's shot was deflected just wide - and that was it. It has been a disturbing start to the season for Villa, who only missed out on Champions League football on the final day of last season, losing controversially to Manchester United, and who harboured similar ambitions at the start of this campaign. So far they have failed to score a goal while collecting only two points, from goalless draws against Newcastle United at home and here at Everton. Villa have lost at Brentford and at home to Crystal Palace. Villa are only the fifth side in Premier League history not to score in their opening four league games, after Sheffield Wednesday (1993-94), Newcastle United (2005-06), Swansea City (2011-12) and Crystal Palace (2017-18). And this was the first time Villa have failed to score in five consecutive Premier League games since a run of six between December 2014 and February 2015. Villa, who are the only team in the fop four divisions not to score this season, are suffering their worst start to a Premier League campaign since 1997/98.","Aston Villa are enduring their worst start to a Premier League campaign since 1997/98, failing to score in their opening four league games – a historic first for the club. Manager Unai Emery expressed his disgust following a goalless draw against Everton, where his side was largely outplayed and fortunate to secure a point, thanks to goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez's saves and Everton striker Beto's missed chances.

This unprecedented scoring drought means Villa have now gone five consecutive Premier League games without a goal, a streak not seen since 2015. With just two points from two goalless draws (against Newcastle United and Everton) and losses to Brentford and Crystal Palace, Aston Villa have managed only one win in their last seven Premier League games.

The alarming statistics highlight a significant downturn for the club, which narrowly missed out on Champions League football last season. Aston Villa currently stand as the only team across England's top four divisions yet to score a goal this season, underscoring a truly disturbing start to their campaign.","यहाँ उस अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

एस्टन विला 1997/98 के बाद से प्रीमियर लीग अभियान में अपनी सबसे खराब शुरुआत का सामना कर रहा है, शुरुआती चार लीग मैचों में गोल करने में नाकाम रहा है – क्लब के इतिहास में ऐसा पहली बार हुआ है। एवर्टन के खिलाफ गोलरहित ड्रॉ के बाद मैनेजर उनाई एमरी ने अपनी गहरी निराशा व्यक्त की, जहां उनकी टीम पर विपक्ष काफी हद तक हावी रहा और गोलकीपर एमिलियानो मार्टिनेज के शानदार बचाव तथा एवर्टन के स्ट्राइकर बेटो के चूके हुए मौकों की बदौलत वह एक अंक हासिल करने में भाग्यशाली रही।

गोल न कर पाने का यह अभूतपूर्व सूखा का मतलब है कि विला अब लगातार पांच प्रीमियर लीग मैचों में गोल करने में नाकाम रही है, 2015 के बाद से ऐसा सिलसिला नहीं देखा गया है। न्यूकैसल युनाइटेड और एवर्टन के खिलाफ दो गोलरहित ड्रॉ से मिले केवल दो अंक और ब्रेंटफोर्ड तथा क्रिस्टल पैलेस से मिली हार के साथ, एस्टन विला अपने पिछले सात प्रीमियर लीग मैचों में केवल एक जीत दर्ज कर पाई है।

ये चिंताजनक आंकड़े क्लब के लिए एक महत्वपूर्ण गिरावट को उजागर करते हैं, जो पिछले सीज़न में चैंपियंस लीग फुटबॉल में जगह बनाने से बाल-बाल चूक गया था। एस्टन विला वर्तमान में इंग्लैंड के शीर्ष चार डिवीजनों में एकमात्र ऐसी टीम है जिसने इस सीज़न में अभी तक एक भी गोल नहीं किया है, जो उनके अभियान की वास्तव में परेशान करने वाली शुरुआत को दर्शाता है।",en,[],,"Aston Villa are yet to score in the Premier League this season and were lucky to come away with a point at Everton, says chief football writer Phil McNulty.",[''],www.bbc.com/sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following their 2023 victory over Essex it was a different story last season as they suffered an eight-wicket thrashing at the hands of Gloucestershire. They appeared to be struggling to keep up with the required run-rate of almost 10 per over this time around before Smeed and Dickson turned the game on its head with a fourth-wicket stand of 88. Smeed and Tom Kohler-Cadmore, who made an outstanding 81 in their semi-final win over Lancashire, had got Somerset off to a lightning start, taking them to 46-0 in the fifth over when Kohler-Cadmore was bowled by Sonny Baker's rapid yorker. On a day where 44 sixes were struck, Kohler-Cadmore hit the biggest of them all when he swiped Chris Wood over the Eric Hollies Stand. But a couple of overs later he was gone as young England paceman Baker yorked him with an 88mph beauty. At 89-3 in the 10th over, the game was in the balance but Smeed continued to find boundaries, hitting 14 fours and a six in total. Perhaps the crucial moment came in the 14th over when Scott Currie dropped Dickson on the boundary with the required run-rate above 12 an over. Smeed chipped Currie to James Vince on the long-off boundary six short of a deserved century to give Hampshire hope before Gregory ended it in the same over with a four and a couple of leg-side sixes. ""The ball seems to fly here especially under the lights and the dew comes in so we always knew we had a chance,"" Smeed told BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra. ""It was some proper hitting from Lewis [Gregory] at the end there as well. ""The guys have been unbelievable in the whole competition, different people have stood up in different games. ""I think that's probably our strength, we've got match winners one to 11 and if it's someone's day they can get us over the line.""","Somerset has firmly established itself as a leading power in English T20 cricket, reaching three consecutive finals and winning two. In a recent thrilling encounter, they clinched a dramatic victory against Hampshire, bouncing back from an eight-wicket thrashing by Gloucestershire last season.

Despite a rapid start from Smeed and Tom Kohler-Cadmore, both were dismissed by Sonny Baker's quick yorkers. With the score at 89-3 in the 10th over and the required run-rate climbing towards 10 per over, the game hung in the balance. Smeed and Dickson then forged a crucial 88-run fourth-wicket partnership, a stand made even more significant when Scott Currie dropped Dickson on the boundary.

Smeed, who struck 14 fours and a six, fell just six runs short of a deserved century. However, Lewis Gregory dramatically sealed the win in the same over with a boundary and two leg-side sixes. Post-match, Smeed credited the conditions, stating, ""The ball seems to fly here especially under the lights and the dew comes in so we always knew we had a chance,"" and praised Gregory's ""proper hitting"" for securing the victory.","यहां इंग्लिश न्यूज़ समरी का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

For six months, he had stewed on his first encounter with Paddy Donovan. Amid the brouhaha that followed a wild night inside Belfast's SSE Arena, it was easy to forget that Crocker had won. Only it didn't feel like it. Sub-par on the night, Crocker was outfought by the all-action Limerick southpaw, but still left with a 'W' next to his name after Donovan was disqualified for landing a blow after the bell at the end of the eighth round. When the inevitable rematch was confirmed, Donovan was installed as the favourite. It did not escape Crocker's notice. And so, within seconds of becoming Belfast's latest world champion via a split decision win at a raucous Windsor Park on Saturday night, Crocker was keen to get his point across when a DAZN microphone was thrust under his chin. ""Nobody gave me a chance in this fight, nobody,"" said the new IBF welterweight champion. ""But I want to say all the people who gave me stick after the last fight, when you write your post tomorrow make sure you write 'Lewis Crocker world champion!'"" Later, in the calmer surroundings of his post-fight press conference, Crocker added: ""Paddy's a great fighter. I saw articles in the build-up saying he could be the greatest Irish fighter of all time. ""That's how much people were building this guy up, and nobody was giving me a chance, so it was good to prove people wrong.""","Lewis Crocker secured the IBF welterweight championship by defeating Paddy Donovan in a highly anticipated rematch, triumphing via split decision. The victory followed their initial controversial encounter, where Crocker won by disqualification after Donovan landed a late blow, despite Crocker feeling outfought.

Donovan was subsequently installed as the favourite for the rematch, with some pundits hailing him as a future ""greatest Irish fighter."" Crocker, feeling underestimated and that ""nobody gave me a chance,"" used this as motivation. After his championship win, Crocker directly addressed his critics, proclaiming, ""When you write your post tomorrow make sure you write 'Lewis Crocker world champion!'"" Despite the intense rivalry, Crocker also expressed respect for Donovan, calling him ""a great fighter"" and a friend.","लुईस क्रॉकर ने एक बहुप्रतीक्षित रीमैच में पैडी डोनोवन को स्प्लिट डिसीजन से हराकर IBF वेल्टरवेट चैंपियनशिप अपने नाम कर ली है।

This unprecedented start marks the first time in 47 years Rangers have failed to win any of their opening five league fixtures, compounded by a humiliating Champions League play-off exit to Club Brugge.

Martin's position appears increasingly precarious, with his recent statements contrasting sharply with previous confidence. When questioned about board support, he gave an unconvincing ""We'll see."" Despite overwhelming fan calls for his departure, he firmly refused to resign, leading to a hostile exchange with a fan media representative during his press conference. The mounting ""venomous wrath"" from fans is particularly acute given renewed hope earlier this year after a US-led consortium took control.

The NFL just knows how to create these match-ups. The Kansas City Chiefs host the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday and this is going to be very interesting because it's definitely a revenge game. The Eagles beat the Chiefs 40-22 in the Super Bowl and nullified them till late in the third quarter. I think the biggest difference between the two teams is their roster. You look at the Eagles, they have Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, AJ Brown. You can keep listing all these great players, and I just don't know who the Chiefs have any more. It's Patrick Mahomes... then what is that supporting cast? Rashee Rice is suspended for their first six games and Xavier Worthy suffered a shoulder injury as he and Travis Kelce ran into each other in last week's defeat by the Los Angeles Chargers in Brazil. That leaves Hollywood Brown and JuJu Smith-Schuster as the main receivers, which puts a lot of pressure on because the Chiefs' run game has not been terrific at all. The Chargers game was very much the Mahomes show. At one point, he had more carries than anybody else on the field. He put his body on the line multiple times - those hits add up, and you don't want to see your superstar quarterback risking his health so early in the season. Mahomes had six scrambles and the Chiefs only ran it 11 other times. Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt combined for 41 yards with 10 of those carries, and that's just not sustainable. After the Eagles, the Chiefs face the New York Giants and then the Baltimore Ravens so, realistically, they could have a 1-3 record after four weeks. Baltimore is a huge game and with the Ravens losing to the Bills last week, they're going to have a lot to prove as well, to show that they want to be on top. The Eagles have a tough run defence, and the Giants have a good defence too, so I think that will be telling, to see how the Chiefs are able to run the ball. These two games stacked together, the Chiefs almost have to think about how they are going to prepare themselves to ensure they're firing on all cylinders for the Ravens. Last year, the Chiefs won so many one-score games, and they're going to have to be much better to do that again. They may be out for revenge against the Eagles but I don't think they have it in them... yet. Rashee Rice is a huge part of their offensive scheme and, without Worthy, they don't have any deep threat either so, I hate to say it, but I really struggle to see what they'll be able to do. I don't see what their answers are right now. In the off-season, the Chiefs lost Joe Thuney, who was huge for them on defence, but they did draft a left tackle in the first round, Josh Simmons, to help protect Mahomes more, and brought in another offensive tackle in Jaylon Moore, so they are doing the right things to create strength on the offensive line. They need to because the AFC West is the toughest it's been in a long time - none of it is given this year. The Chargers beat the Chiefs, the Las Vegas Raiders have got better and Bo Nix has only got stronger with the Denver Broncos. I still think the Chiefs will make the play-offs but if they carry on like this, I would be concerned.","This week's NFL schedule features several high-stakes Super Bowl rematches, notably the Buffalo Bills facing the Pittsburgh Steelers, who won their Super Bowl contest last year 24-21. However, the spotlight is heavily on Sunday's game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles, a revenge match for the Chiefs after a 40-22 Super Bowl defeat to the Eagles in 2010.

The Chiefs enter this contest facing significant challenges, largely due to a depleted offensive supporting cast for quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Key receiver Rashee Rice is suspended for six games, and Xavier Worthy is sidelined with a shoulder injury, leaving limited reliable targets like Hollywood Brown and JuJu Smith-Schuster. This is compounded by a struggling run game, as evidenced by Isiah Pacheco and Kareem Hunt's combined 41 yards on 10 carries in their recent loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.

In that Chargers game—the Chiefs' first win against them since 2002—Mahomes was forced to frequently scramble, leading the team in carries and scrimmage yards, underscoring his heavy reliance and increased personal risk due to insufficient offensive support. These issues contribute to the Chiefs' concerning recent form, having won only one of their last seven games, including a 24-17 defeat by the Denver Broncos.

In stark contrast, the Eagles boast a formidable roster featuring offensive weapons like Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley, and AJ Brown, presenting a tough defensive challenge, particularly against the run. The Chiefs also face a demanding upcoming schedule with games against the Giants and Ravens, potentially leading to a 1-3 record after four weeks.

Despite efforts to bolster their offensive line with draftees Josh Simmons and Jaylon Moore, the Chiefs' struggles are exacerbated by the competitiveness of the AFC West, where rivals like the Chargers, Raiders, and Broncos have significantly improved. While the Chiefs may be looking for revenge, their current form, coupled with injuries and a tough schedule, raises significant concerns about their playoff aspirations if these issues are not swiftly addressed.","इस सप्ताह के एनएफएल (NFL) शेड्यूल में कई अहम सुपर बाउल रीमैच शामिल हैं, खासकर बफ़ेलो बिल्स (Buffalo Bills) का सामना पिट्सबर्ग स्टीलर्स (Pittsburgh Steelers) से होगा, जिन्होंने पिछले साल 24-21 से सुपर बाउल मुकाबला जीता था। हालाँकि, रविवार को कैनसस सिटी चीफ़्स (Kansas City Chiefs) और फिलाडेल्फिया ईगल्स (Philadelphia Eagles) के बीच होने वाले मैच पर सबकी नज़र है। यह चीफ़्स के लिए 2010 में ईगल्स से 40-22 की सुपर बाउल हार का बदला लेने का मौका है।

चीफ़्स इस मुकाबले में कई अहम चुनौतियों का सामना कर रहे हैं, जिसका मुख्य कारण क्वार्टरबैक पैट्रिक महोम्स (Patrick Mahomes) के लिए आक्रमण (offensive) सहयोगी खिलाड़ियों की कमी है। मुख्य रिसीवर राशी राइस (Rashee Rice) को छह मैचों के लिए निलंबित कर दिया गया है, और ज़ेवियर वर्थी (Xavier Worthy) कंधे की चोट के कारण बाहर हैं, जिससे हॉलीवुड ब्राउन (Hollywood Brown) और जूजू स्मिथ-शुस्टर (JuJu Smith-Schuster) जैसे भरोसेमंद लक्ष्य (targets) बहुत सीमित बचे हैं। इसके अलावा, उनकी रनिंग गेम (running game) भी संघर्ष कर रही है, जैसा कि लॉस एंजिल्स चार्जर्स (Los Angeles Chargers) के खिलाफ उनकी हालिया हार में इसाया पेचेको (Isiah Pacheco) और करीम हंट (Kareem Hunt) के 10 कैरी पर संयुक्त 41 गज से स्पष्ट होता है।

चार्जर्स के खिलाफ उस मैच में—जो 2002 के बाद चार्जर्स के खिलाफ चीफ़्स की पहली जीत थी—महोम्स को अक्सर दौड़ना पड़ा (scramble), जिससे वह टीम में सबसे ज़्यादा कैरी (carries) और स्क्रिमेज यार्ड (scrimmage yards) बनाने वाले खिलाड़ी बन गए। यह अपर्याप्त आक्रमण समर्थन के कारण उन पर अत्यधिक निर्भरता और उनके व्यक्तिगत जोखिम में वृद्धि को रेखांकित करता है। ये मुद्दे चीफ़्स की हालिया चिंताजनक फॉर्म में योगदान करते हैं, जिन्होंने अपने पिछले सात मैचों में से केवल एक जीता है, जिसमें डेनवर ब्रोंकोस (Denver Broncos) से 24-17 की हार भी शामिल है।

इसके बिल्कुल विपरीत, ईगल्स के पास जालेन हर्ट्स (Jalen Hurts), साक्वन बार्कले (Saquon Barkley) और एजे ब्राउन (AJ Brown) जैसे आक्रमणकारी हथियारों (offensive weapons) से लैस एक formidable roster है, जो एक कठिन रक्षात्मक चुनौती पेश करता है, खासकर रन गेम के खिलाफ। चीफ़्स को आगे एक मुश्किल शेड्यूल का भी सामना करना है, जिसमें जायंट्स (Giants) और रेवेन्स (Ravens) के खिलाफ मैच हैं, जिससे चार सप्ताह के बाद उनका रिकॉर्ड संभावित रूप से 1-3 हो सकता है।

ड्राफ्टी जोश सिमंस (Josh Simmons) और जेयलन मूर (Jaylon Moore) के साथ अपनी आक्रमण पंक्ति (offensive line) को मजबूत करने के प्रयासों के बावजूद, चीफ़्स की मुश्किलें एएफसी वेस्ट (AFC West) की प्रतिस्पर्धात्मकता से और बढ़ गई हैं, जहाँ चार्जर्स (Chargers), रेडर्स (Raiders) और ब्रोंकोस (Broncos) जैसे प्रतिद्वंदियों ने काफी सुधार किया है। जहाँ चीफ़्स बदला लेने की फिराक में हो सकते हैं, वहीं उनकी वर्तमान फॉर्म, चोटों और एक कठिन शेड्यूल के कारण उनकी प्लेऑफ़ (playoff) आकांक्षाओं (aspirations) को लेकर गंभीर चिंताएँ पैदा होती हैं, यदि इन मुद्दों को तुरंत हल नहीं किया गया।",en,[],,BBC Sport columnist Phoebe Schecter explains why she struggles to see the Kansas City Chiefs winning their Super Bowl rematch with the Philadelphia Eagles in week two of the NFL season.,[''],www.bbc.com/sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was a tactical weapon Rory Delap used to shake up the Premier League after Stoke's arrival in 2008 - causing havoc by launching the ball into the box. And now it is happening more and more in the top flight, with Brentford proving to be the masters of it. Against Chelsea on Saturday, Fabio Carvalho scored a late goal following a Kevin Schade long throw to secure a 2-2 draw. That was the last of a glut of long throws during the game from first Michael Kayode and then Schade. Earlier on, Chelsea keeper Robert Sanchez had tipped a Schade long throw over the bar even though nobody had appeared to touch it on the way through. It is the seventh goal that the Bees have scored from long throws since the start of last season, five more than other Premier League team. It might not be pretty, but it is effective. ""I felt there's a little bit of snobbery in the game around scenarios like that,"" said Brentford boss Keith Andrews. ""If the big boys do it, then it seems to be accepted."" Asked how to avoid conceding goals from long throws, Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca said: ""First of all, try not to concede the throw-in. ""They have Kayode, Jensen, Schade and even Pinnock who are strong on throw-ins.""

""The day before a game you practise defending corners and free-kicks but not long throws. ""Because it's coming in from a different angle, it creates chaos. It's something teams should work on more."" Former Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Shay Given added: ""It's refreshing. Sometimes a bit of old school 'throw it into the mixer' can cause a bit of carnage.""","The long throw is experiencing a significant resurgence in football, once again becoming a potent tactical weapon, particularly in the top flight. The tactic, which recalls Rory Delap's disruptive throws for Stoke, is now being mastered by teams like Brentford.

Brentford recently showcased its effectiveness against Chelsea, where Fabio Carvalho scored a late goal from a Kevin Schade long throw, securing a 2-2 draw following multiple dangerous throws throughout the game from Schade and Michael Kayode. This goal was one of seven Brentford has scored from long throws since the start of last season – five more than any other Premier League team – highlighting its effectiveness despite being viewed by some as ""not pretty.""

Brentford boss Keith Andrews acknowledged a ""snobbery"" surrounding the tactic, suggesting it receives more acceptance when employed by ""big boys."" Opponents, such as Chelsea, now acknowledge the threat, with manager Stuart Pearce specifically naming Brentford's key throwers like Kayode, Jensen, Schade, and Ethan Pinnock.

Pundits like Ashley Williams explain the defensive challenge, calling it ""weirdly difficult"" because the different angle creates ""chaos,"" compounded by a lack of specific practice compared to defending corners and free-kicks. Former Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Shay Given called the tactic ""refreshing,"" advocating for teams to improve their defense against this ""old school 'throw it into the mixer'"" approach that causes significant disruption.","फुटबॉल में लंबी थ्रो की जोरदार वापसी हो रही है, और यह एक बार फिर एक शक्तिशाली रणनीतिक हथियार बन गई है, खासकर शीर्ष स्तरीय लीग में। यह रणनीति, जो स्टोक के लिए रॉरी डेलैप के विध्वंसक थ्रो की याद दिलाती है, अब ब्रेंटफोर्ड जैसी टीमों द्वारा अपनाई जा रही है।

ब्रेंटफोर्ड ने हाल ही में चेल्सी के खिलाफ इसकी प्रभावशीलता का प्रदर्शन किया, जहां केविन शादे के एक लंबी थ्रो से फैबियो कार्वाल्हो ने देर से गोल कर मैच 2-2 से ड्रॉ करा दिया। पूरे मैच में शादे और माइकल कायोड के कई खतरनाक थ्रो देखने को मिले थे। यह गोल पिछले सीज़न की शुरुआत से ब्रेंटफोर्ड द्वारा लंबी थ्रो से किए गए सात गोलों में से एक था – जो किसी भी अन्य प्रीमियर लीग टीम से पांच अधिक हैं – और यह इसकी प्रभावशीलता को उजागर करता है, भले ही कुछ लोग इसे ""आकर्षक नहीं"" मानते हों।

ब्रेंटफोर्ड के बॉस कीथ एंड्रयूज ने इस रणनीति को लेकर एक ""अभिजात्यवाद"" (snobbery) की बात स्वीकार की, उनका सुझाव है कि जब इसका उपयोग ""बड़ी टीमों"" द्वारा किया जाता है तो इसे अधिक स्वीकार्यता मिलती है। चेल्सी जैसे विरोधी अब इस खतरे को स्वीकार करते हैं, और मैनेजर स्टुअर्ट पियर्स ने ब्रेंटफोर्ड के प्रमुख थ्रो करने वाले खिलाड़ियों – कायोड, जेनसेन, शादे और एथन पिनॉक – का विशेष रूप से नाम लिया।

एशले विलियम्स जैसे विशेषज्ञों ने रक्षात्मक चुनौती की व्याख्या करते हुए इसे ""अजीबोगरीब मुश्किल"" बताया है, क्योंकि इसका अलग कोण ""उथल-पुथल"" पैदा करता है, और कॉर्नर व फ्री-किक का बचाव करने की तुलना में इसके लिए विशिष्ट अभ्यास की कमी इसे और जटिल बना देती है। आयरलैंड गणराज्य के पूर्व गोलकीपर शे गिवन ने इस रणनीति को ""ताजगी भरा"" बताया और टीमों से इस ""पुराने ढर्रे के 'भीड़ में गेंद फेंकने' वाले"" तरीके के खिलाफ अपनी रक्षा को बेहतर बनाने की वकालत की, जो महत्वपूर्ण व्यवधान पैदा करता है।",en,[],,Brentford are the masters of the long throw and it showed again with their late equaliser against Chelsea on Saturday.,[''],www.bbc.com/sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Speaking in June, Guardiola said the two keepers they have - Ederson and Stefan Ortega - ""will continue"", with both going on to play at the Club World Cup in the USA. Having not seemingly been in the market for a new keeper, City then ended up signing three. Marcus Bettinelli was brought in to cover the departure of Carson, while City had matching rights on Newcastle's £27m bid for Burnley's James Trafford, and the club felt the prospect of re-signing the Englishman was too good to turn down. Ederson, meanwhile, went from being declared Guardiola's number one, external before the opening Premier League game against Wolves to being shipped off to Fenerbahce a mere 18 days later. In came Gianluigi Donnarumma from Paris St-Germain on deadline day after the Italy number one was brutally axed by Luis Enrique, despite helping the club to the Treble last season. Despite being deemed surplus to requirements, Ortega remains at the Etihad too, having turned down options to leave, meaning Guardiola has four first-team keepers on the books. ""A lot of people didn't really understand the true value of Ederson because his shot-stopping is great, but his ability to get on the ball and to be the spare player that can create something,"" former City defender Nedum Onuoha told BBC's Football Focus. ""Now he's gone, the people who are trying to fill those boots won't be able to do it in the same way. ""From a City perspective, if their goalkeeper continues to get pressed and make those sorts of errors, it will encourage the opposition and change how City play."" It is hard to envisage Donnarumma being signed to sit on the bench, which leaves Trafford in a situation where he thought he was coming in as the long-term heir to Ederson, but instead playing second fiddle to the towering Italian. Despite being only 26, Donnarumma brings vast experience as an elite, match-winning keeper with incredible shot-stopping ability, and he now has the opportunity to showcase his talents in England. ""He is so tall; he is so huge,"" Guardiola said. ""[From] all the keepers we want safe balls, give confidence to the team, have personality and a big presence. ""In the biggest stages in the Champions League last season, at Villa Park, Anfield and in many games, he proved how good he is."" With United also experiencing difficulties in between the sticks, they signed Belgian Sanne Lammens on deadline day, but Amorim confirmed Altay Bayindir will start in goal on Sunday.","This summer has seen considerable confusion surrounding the goalkeeping situation at ""City."" Despite manager Pep Guardiola stating in June that Ederson and Ortega would continue, the club subsequently made surprising moves, signing three new goalkeepers after not seemingly being in the market.

In a major twist, first-choice keeper Ederson, initially declared Guardiola's number one, was unexpectedly shipped off to Fenerbahce just 18 days later. Former City defender Nedum Onuoha lamented Ederson's departure, highlighting his unique value for both shot-stopping and his ability on the ball, suggesting his replacements would struggle to replicate his style, potentially encouraging opposition pressure and altering City's play.

Meanwhile, Italy's number one, Gianluigi Donnarumma, appears to have joined City, despite earlier reports linking him to PSG on transfer deadline day. He is not expected to sit on the bench, with Guardiola praising his ""huge"" stature and ""big presence"" as a keeper who provides ""safe balls, confidence, personality."" Donnarumma brings vast experience and elite shot-stopping, with Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers also commending his Champions League performances.

James Trafford, for whom City had matching rights after a £27m bid from Newcastle, initially believed he was the long-term heir to Ederson but now finds himself playing ""second fiddle"" to Donnarumma. Marcus Bettinelli was also brought in to cover a departure, and despite being deemed surplus to requirements, Ortega remains at the Etihad, contributing to Guardiola reportedly having ""four first-team keepers on the books.""

The article also briefly notes goalkeeping difficulties at Manchester United, with Altay Bayindir set to start and Sanne Lammens joining on deadline day.","**इस गर्मी में ""सिटी"" में गोलकीपिंग की स्थिति को लेकर काफी भ्रम देखा गया है। जून में प्रबंधक पेप गार्डियोला ने कहा था कि एडरसन और ओर्टेगा बने रहेंगे, इसके बावजूद क्लब ने बाद में चौंकाने वाले कदम उठाए। ऐसा लग रहा था कि वे बाजार में सक्रिय नहीं हैं, फिर भी तीन नए गोलकीपरों को साइन किया गया।**

एक बड़े मोड़ के रूप में, पहले नंबर के गोलकीपर एडरसन, जिन्हें शुरुआत में गार्डियोला का नंबर वन घोषित किया गया था, केवल 18 दिनों के बाद अप्रत्याशित रूप से फेनरबाचे भेज दिए गए। सिटी के पूर्व डिफेंडर नेदुम ओनुओहा ने एडरसन के जाने पर अफ़सोस जताया। उन्होंने शॉट रोकने और गेंद पर उनकी क्षमता दोनों के लिए उनके अनूठे मूल्य पर प्रकाश डाला, यह सुझाव देते हुए कि उनके प्रतिस्थापन उनकी शैली को दोहराने के लिए संघर्ष करेंगे, जिससे संभवतः विपक्षी टीमों का दबाव बढ़ेगा और सिटी के खेल में बदलाव आएगा।

इस बीच, इटली के नंबर वन, जियानलुइगी डोनारुम्मा, ट्रांसफर डेडलाइन के दिन उन्हें पीएसजी से जोड़ने वाली शुरुआती रिपोर्टों के बावजूद, सिटी में शामिल हो गए लगते हैं। उनके बेंच पर बैठने की उम्मीद नहीं है, गार्डियोला ने उनकी ""विशाल"" कद-काठी और ""बड़ी उपस्थिति"" की प्रशंसा करते हुए कहा कि वह एक ऐसे कीपर हैं जो ""सुरक्षित गेंदें, आत्मविश्वास और व्यक्तित्व"" प्रदान करते हैं। डोनारुम्मा व्यापक अनुभव और बेहतरीन शॉट-स्टॉपिंग क्षमता लाते हैं, लिवरपूल के बॉस ब्रेंडन रॉजर्स ने भी उनके चैंपियंस लीग प्रदर्शन की सराहना की।

जेम्स ट्रैफर्ड, जिनके लिए न्यूकैसल से £27 मिलियन की बोली के बाद सिटी के पास मैचिंग राइट्स थे, शुरुआत में मानते थे कि वह एडरसन के दीर्घकालिक उत्तराधिकारी हैं, लेकिन अब खुद को डोनारुम्मा के 'दूसरे नंबर' पर पाते हैं। मार्केस बेटिनेली को भी एक और खिलाड़ी के जाने की भरपाई के लिए लाया गया था, और जरूरत से ज़्यादा माने जाने के बावजूद, ओर्टेगा एतिहाद में बने हुए हैं, जिससे रिपोर्ट्स के अनुसार गार्डियोला के पास ""चार फर्स्ट-टीम गोलकीपर"" हो गए हैं।

For government officials, being called ""heartless"" is an occupational hazard. But Albania has chosen to turn that insult into a positive quality, by appointing an AI minister. Not a minister for artificial intelligence. Rather, a cabinet member who is, literally, the work of AI. The new addition is, like a pop star, known simply by the single name: Diella. Prime Minister Edi Rama introduced her as a member of his new cabinet on Thursday, four months after securing his fourth term in office in May elections. However, the move was symbolic rather than official, as Albania's constitution insists that government ministers must be mentally competent citizens aged at least 18. Still, the advantages of appointing a bot over a human are obvious. Diella, whose name means sun in Albanian, is unlikely to be the source of any unflattering leaks about the government. She will only be power-hungry in the sense of the electricity she consumes. And a damaging expenses scandal would appear to be out of the question. In fact, corruption was uppermost in Rama's mind when he made Diella part of his team as minister for public procurement. Her role will be to ensure that Albania will become ""a country where public tenders are 100% free of corruption"". ""We're working with a brilliant team, which is not only Albanian but also international, to come out with the first full AI model in public procurement,"" the prime minister told the BBC. ""Not only will we wipe out every potential influence on public biddings – we will also make the process much faster, much more efficient and totally accountable.""

While the appointment is non-official due to constitutional requirements for human ministers, Rama, who recently secured his fourth term, emphasized Diella's advantages: she is immune to political ambition, leaks, or expense scandals. Her primary role will be to ensure public tenders are ""100% free of corruption,"" faster, more efficient, and fully accountable, working with a combined Albanian and international team on an AI model for procurement.

Two decades later, the retailer's sprawling campus in Bengaluru city - often called India's Silicon Valley - has almost entirely transformed in both scale and scope. It is a ""strategic engine"" that delivers some of the most complex tasks - from due diligence of vendors to data analytics that predict demand, better inventory planning and forecasting customer behaviour, says Sumit Mitra, CEO of Tesco Business Solutions Even the store design of a neighbourhood Tesco Express or super store in the UK now happens thousands of miles away in India. Tesco's expansion reflects the spectacular boom in India's Global Capability Centres (GCCs) - offshore back-office units of global multinational companies that started as captive call centres or help desk outposts, but now perform a plethora of strategic tasks from IT to finance, design, research and development, and even AI-led automation. While global trade protectionism could derail some of this growth, the GCCs have become a major force to reckon with. They provide not just ""labour arbitrage"" but also ""intellectual arbitrage"", Mr Mitra told the BBC in an email interview, when asked why Tesco is expanding its footprint. To put it simply, it's the abundance of talent available across domains and not just cost savings that is driving this boom. Getty Images Tesco's GCC in India even designs the store layout of its supermarkets Dhruva Advisors, which helps GCCs navigate the complex task of global tax compliance, calls these outposts ""digital twins"" of parent companies, situated across the oceans. Everyone from Google to Goldman Sachs and the lingerie brand Victoria's Secret now has a GCC in India. The number of multinationals that operate these centres has ballooned from 700 in 2010 to more than 1,700 as of last year. They employ two million people and bring in $65bn in annual revenue. While challenges loom - with trade barriers going up globally and a strong backlash against outsourcing to countries like India - the future appears heady: consulting firm EY expects the market for GCCs to top $100bn by 2030 as the sector grows at a compounded rate of 14%. So what's powering this growth? Besides its growing base of engineers, designers and digitally skilled workers, India is now among the fastest-growing artificial intelligence (AI) talent hubs in the world. The depth of digital, data, AI, and engineering expertise all coalescing at one location makes India highly sought after, say industry leaders. ""You could hire these people in the US. But the availability of talent in one location made Bengaluru very attractive for us and we could build a big footprint quickly,"" said Dan Schiappa of Arctic Wolf, an American cybersecurity company which opened its first GCC in Bengaluru and in Noida - a suburb of Delhi - last year. Couple the availability of a tech-savvy workforce with supportive government policies, including individual state-level support - and new GCCs are springing up beyond the metro cities in tier-II towns as well. Smaller towns offer cheaper talent, and also cheaper real estate, prompting several firms like French spirits maker Pernod Ricard to look beyond the metros. It has opened a GCC in Nashik, a city in Maharashtra state. The trend has sparked a property boom. ""Around 31% of overall office leasing space demand in India last year came from GCCs, and it is growing,"" Anuj Puri of ANAROCK, a property consultancy, told the BBC. Getty Images From Goldman Sachs to the lingerie brand Victoria's Secret, there are 1,700 multinationals operating GCCs in India","India's Global Capability Centres (GCCs) have experienced a spectacular transformation, evolving from initial back-office functions into strategic hubs that are now critical ""digital twins"" for global multinationals. Companies ranging from Tesco and Google to Goldman Sachs and Victoria's Secret utilize these centres for highly complex tasks, including vendor due diligence, data analytics, and even store design for their global operations.

This boom is primarily driven by India's vast pool of highly skilled talent in engineering, digital, and artificial intelligence, offering not just ""labour arbitrage"" but ""intellectual arbitrage."" The sector has seen the number of multinational-operated centres surge from 700 in 2010 to over 1,700, collectively employing two million people and generating $65 billion in annual revenue, with projections to reach $100 billion by 2030.

Fuelled by supportive government policies and the availability of a tech-savvy workforce, GCCs are expanding beyond major tech hubs like Bengaluru and Noida into smaller cities such as Nashik, where they are also sparking a significant property boom. While India's GCCs are a major force expected to outpace global growth, they face potential challenges from rising global trade protectionism and a growing backlash against outsourcing.","भारत के ग्लोबल कैपेबिलिटी सेंटर्स (जीसीसी) में शानदार परिवर्तन आया है। ये शुरुआत में केवल बैक-ऑफिस कार्य संभालते थे, लेकिन अब रणनीतिक केंद्र बन गए हैं और वैश्विक बहुराष्ट्रीय कंपनियों के लिए महत्वपूर्ण 'डिजिटल ट्विन्स' की भूमिका निभाते हैं। टेस्को (Tesco) और गूगल (Google) से लेकर गोल्डमैन सैक्स (Goldman Sachs) और विक्टोरियाज़ सीक्रेट (Victoria's Secret) जैसी कंपनियां अपने वैश्विक ऑपरेशन्स के लिए इन केंद्रों का उपयोग अत्यधिक जटिल कार्यों जैसे विक्रेता ड्यू डिलिजेंस (vendor due diligence), डेटा एनालिटिक्स (data analytics) और यहाँ तक कि स्टोर डिज़ाइन के लिए भी करती हैं।

""We work tirelessly to remove violative content and bad actors from the platform through our 24/7 moderation system and respond swiftly to abuse reports, including banning accounts and reporting to law enforcement.""

In 2021, Frances Haugen who once worked as a product manager on the company's civic integrity team, said Instagram was impacting the mental health of teenagers but did not share its own findings suggesting that the platform was a ""toxic"" place for many youngsters.

Ms. Savage specifically cited identifying coordinated pedophile rings using the Roblox app on Meta's VR platforms to pay children to strip with virtual currency (Robux) convertible to real money. Despite her flagging this issue, Roblox remains available in the Meta VR app store.

सुश्री सैवेज ने विशेष रूप से मेटा के वीआर प्लेटफॉर्म पर रोबॉक्स ऐप का उपयोग करके समन्वित बाल यौन शोषण करने वाले गिरोहों की पहचान करने का हवाला दिया, जो बच्चों को वर्चुअल मुद्रा (रोबक्स) से कपड़े उतारने के लिए भुगतान करते थे, जिसे वास्तविक धन में बदला जा सकता है। उनके द्वारा इस मुद्दे को उजागर करने के बावजूद, रोबॉक्स मेटा वीआर ऐप स्टोर में उपलब्ध है।

मेटा ने इन आरोपों का पुरजोर खंडन किया है, उन्हें ""बकवास"" करार दिया है और दावा किया है कि वे ""चुनिंदा रूप से लीक हुए आंतरिक दस्तावेजों...जिन्हें विशेष रूप से एक झूठी कहानी गढ़ने के लिए चुना गया है,"" पर आधारित हैं। कंपनी ने कहा कि उसने लगभग 180 युवा सुरक्षा-संबंधी अध्ययनों को मंजूरी दी है और अपने क्वेस्ट हेडसेट पर माता-पिता की निगरानी के उपकरण प्रदान करती है।

The band had stayed there a year earlier, in 1974, but returned the following summer after the success of their song Killer Queen. ""They hadn't been very financially well off in [1974], but when they came back in 1975, they were very famous and very well off,"" said Kingsley Ward, co-founder of the studio. During the later visit, Kingsley said the band had been staying at the studio for a week and ""hadn't done much"", something he mentioned to guitarist Brian May as they were playing frisbee outside. May responded that frontman Freddie Mercury was in the house ""writing something"". Kingsley went back inside and sidled up to the piano where Mercury was practising - it was a new song with the working title Freddie's Thing. ""I had no idea… but it was Bohemian Rhapsody,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. This week marks 50 years since recording was completed on the song – one of the most iconic of all time – in the Welsh countryside. To celebrate, last night May and fellow band member Roger Taylor took to the stage with the BBC Symphony Orchestra for the Last Night of the Proms Finale. The song has also been a recent hit on social media, after a flash mob performance of the song by French pianist Julien Cohen and a group of 30 musicians he assembled brought a Parisian street to a standstill – since gaining more than 11 million likes on Instagram. Olly Pearson, an electric guitarist from Wrexham, performed in the video, including an energetic take on May's famous guitar solo. ""It was just so amazing – I don't even have words for it,"" Olly said of the experience. Kingsley Ward co-founded the studios with his brother Charles in the 1960s Rockfield is part of rock royalty, born in the 1960s after Kingsley and his brother Charles chose to go alone after being turned down for a recording opportunity by legendary producer and ""fifth Beatle"" George Martin. As well as Queen, it is where Oasis have forged some of their biggest hits, and where the late Ozzy Osbourne, the Prince of Darkness, arrived in 1970 with his new band Black Sabbath. ""We were very loud and Rockfield allowed us the freedom,"" Osbourne once said. ""No-one would allow us to play as loud as that. The roof tiles were rattling."" Of all the musical memories made at Rockfield, Kingsley said hearing Mercury's solo while recording Bohemian Rhapsody is one of his favourites. ""I remember that particular solo because it was so outstanding,"" he said. Even when Queen finished recording and left the studio, he had still not heard the song - with its range of styles including a ballad, operatic and hard rock components – in full. ""It was done [in the studio] in three sections, and when it left here I only ever heard the sections. They were never actually put together as a unit,"" he said. Kingsley said he first heard it in full on the radio when he was driving down the M4 motorway. ""I was amazed when I heard it. I thought it was fantastic,"" he recalled. Simon Pearson Electric guitarist Olly Pearson performed as part of the flash mob in Paris","This week marks 50 years since Queen completed the recording of their iconic song ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" at Rockfield Studios near Monmouth.

Ward, initially unaware of its significance, later heard the multi-sectional masterpiece in its entirety for the first time on the radio.

The shrine to knowledge, which cost the equivalent of about £100 million in today's money at its 1900 opening, holds archives including ancients fragments of scriptures and the notes of computing pioneer Alan Turing. It is celebrating its 125th anniversary this year but little is known about its Cuban-born founder who, on her death, left an estate worth a staggering £376 million. Born Enriqueta Augustina Tennant in 1843, she was the daughter of a French-American woman and a merchant from northern England. Dr Elizabeth Gow, who is a manuscript curator at John Rylands Library, says: ""In Cuba, she was part of the privileged class of white plantation owners - the family did own enslaved people."" Following her father's death in a rail accident, Enriqueta moved to New York where her mother Camila married the exiled Polish musician Julian Fontana, better known for his work with the composer Frederic Chopin. University of Manchester The John Rylands Library cost the equivalent of about £100m in today's money The family later lived in Paris, until Camila's death in 1855. Enriqueta was then sent with her younger siblings to live with her father's family in England. Dr Gow says her Cuban-born identity was seen as ""less prestigious"" and ""viewed as being tainted and not quite British, even though her father was British"". ""It's unclear whether she inherited anything or much. Her uncle and, for a while, her stepfather both received money from the estate for caring for the children and giving them an education."" Despite growing up among affluence, it seems that Enriqueta did not possess much wealth and she later became a companion and aide to Martha, the second wife of the Lancashire textile manufacturer John Rylands - dubbed ""Manchester's first multi-millionaire"". Dr Gow, who is writing a biography of Enriqueta, describes him as a ""Lancashire man through and through"" whose father's firm Rylands & Sons grew from a small setup into one of the most successful in Britain. Getty Images John Rylands was possibly Britain's first self-made multimillionaire Known for working up to 19 hours a day, John Rylands was also rated for his business acumen. ""I think he's actually Britain's first self-made multimillionaire, because in Britain at the time most of the people with huge amounts of wealth were aristocrats,"" Dr Gow says. ""In Victorian terms, he'd made himself rich off his own work. Obviously we know that a lot of people laboured to produce that wealth both in Britain but also in America and India, growing cotton. ""By the 1890s, when Enriqueta Rylands had inherited his share in the company, slavery had been abolished, but there were still exploitative working practices which underpinned the huge wealth that went into building the library."" Yet John Rylands, who had a strong Christian faith, supported the abolition of slavery and sold cotton by people who were not enslaved in a movement similar to the current fair trade trend. He was known to have built model mills in Wigan and donated to the needy across Manchester and in Rome, to the extent that he was granted an award by Italian royalty. University of Manchester Based in Deansgate, the John Rylands Library took 10 years to construct Following the death of his wife Martha, the 75-year-old married Enriqueta, then aged 32. ""She wasn't considered a young wife, so if she'd intended to marry and have children, she was older than you'd expect."" Rylands' seven children from his first marriage died during his lifetime and along with Enriqueta, he adopted a son and daughter. The couple supported educational projects locally and, a year after his death at their Longford Hall home in Stretford, Enriqueta commissioned the library in Deansgate. She inherited most of her husband's wealth - estimated at £291 million in current money - and invested a significant part in the collections and 10-year construction of the library, which opened on New Year's Day 1900. University of Manchester The library's collection includes early Biblical scrolls and illuminated Turkish manuscripts There are no records of Enriqueta's diaries, making it ""difficult to get a sense of her as a person"", says Dr Gow. ""What we know first-hand is what she was like when she was founding the library, when she was in her 40s and 50s. ""I think especially to do that as a woman in the 1890s, you get the impression a lot of people didn't take her seriously and she got frustrated with that sometimes. ""She usually moderated what she said but, at the same time, found ways to generally get her own way, mostly by being the one with the money."" About 27,000 people visited the library in its first year and Dr Gow says ""some commentators in London couldn't comprehend why rare books and manuscripts were going to Manchester"" when Enriqueta bought collections. ""But I think the Manchester press was quite unified in explaining that it was a cultured city and this cultural philanthropy would benefit the city, and shouldn't just be hived off to London."" 'Never-ending' archive The archive now includes Babylonian tablets that date from 3,000 years ago, fragments of early Biblical scrolls and Chinese printing. Among the library's staff was the Iraqi-born historian Alphonse Mingana, who posthumously achieved fame after it was recently revealed he acquired one of the earliest surviving fragments of the Quran, which is kept in Birmingham. Dr Gow believes the Rylands archive has a ""never-ending supply of amazing things"", adding: ""One of the things which we're going to show regularly is a copy of the Gutenberg Bible, which is the first substantial book printed with movable type in Europe."" She says she ""can't name just one"" highlight of the collection but says one of her favourite items is a ""beautifully illuminated Turkish manuscript with the love story of Layla and Majnoon from the 15th Century"". More than a century after its launch, the library continues to wow 350,000 visitors every year.","## Manchester's 'Hogwarts-Style' Library Celebrates 125 Years, Unveiling Founder Enriqueta Rylands' Remarkable Story

The University of Manchester's John Rylands Library, a Gothic architectural marvel often likened to a ""Hogwarts-style"" institution, is celebrating its 125th anniversary this year. At its opening in 1900, the library cost the equivalent of £100 million in today's money and was the ambitious vision of its enigmatic founder, Enriqueta Rylands.

Housing an extraordinary collection of archives, including ancient scripture fragments, notes from computing pioneer Alan Turing, Babylonian tablets, and a Gutenberg Bible, the library continues to draw 350,000 visitors annually to its Manchester home.

Born Enriqueta Augustina Tennant in Cuba in 1843 to a privileged white plantation-owning family, her early life involved significant travel from New York to Paris before settling in England with her father's family after her mother's death. Despite a seemingly affluent upbringing, Dr. Elizabeth Gow, a manuscript curator and biographer, notes that Enriqueta initially possessed little personal wealth and faced social challenges due to her Cuban identity being perceived as ""less prestigious"" in Victorian Britain.

Her path changed when she became a companion to Martha, the second wife of John Rylands, a pioneering Lancashire textile manufacturer and arguably Britain's first self-made multimillionaire. Known for his intense work ethic, strong Christian faith, and philanthropic efforts, John Rylands was a vocal abolitionist who supported ethical, fair trade-like practices. After Martha's death, the 75-year-old John married Enriqueta, then 32.

Upon John's death, Enriqueta inherited most of his immense fortune, an estimated £291 million in current money. She dedicated a significant portion to commissioning and constructing the library in Manchester, a ten-year undertaking. Dr. Gow highlights Enriqueta's resolute character, noting that despite facing dismissiveness as a woman in the 1890s, she often leveraged her financial independence to ensure her plans for the library came to fruition.

The John Rylands Library quickly gained renown, with its ""never-ending supply of amazing things"" challenging the prevailing notion that such significant cultural treasures should be confined to London. More than a century later, it stands as a testament to Enriqueta's enduring philanthropic legacy, a global shrine to knowledge in the heart of Manchester.","**मैनचेस्टर की 'हॉगवर्ट्स-शैली' लाइब्रेरी 125 साल का जश्न मना रही है, संस्थापक एनरीकेटा रिलैंड्स की अद्भुत कहानी सामने आई**

मैनचेस्टर विश्वविद्यालय की जॉन रिलैंड्स लाइब्रेरी, एक गोथिक स्थापत्य कला का अद्भुत नमूना जिसे अक्सर 'हॉगवर्ट्स-शैली' की संस्था से तुलना की जाती है, इस साल अपनी 125वीं वर्षगांठ मना रही है। 1900 में अपने उद्घाटन के समय, इस लाइब्रेरी की लागत आज के हिसाब से £100 मिलियन पाउंड के बराबर थी, और यह इसकी रहस्यमयी संस्थापक एनरीकेटा रिलैंड्स की महत्वाकांक्षी परिकल्पना थी।

प्राचीन धर्मग्रंथों के अंश, कंप्यूटिंग अग्रणी एलन ट्यूरिंग के नोट्स, बेबीलोनियन टैबलेट और एक गुटेनबर्ग बाइबिल सहित अभिलेखागारों के एक असाधारण संग्रह के साथ, यह लाइब्रेरी सालाना 350,000 आगंतुकों को अपने मैनचेस्टर स्थित स्थान पर आकर्षित करती है।

एनरीकेटा ऑगस्टिना टेन्नेंट का जन्म 1843 में क्यूबा में एक विशेषाधिकार प्राप्त श्वेत वृक्षारोपण-मालिक परिवार में हुआ था। उनकी माँ की मृत्यु के बाद अपने पिता के परिवार के साथ इंग्लैंड में बसने से पहले, उनके शुरुआती जीवन में न्यूयॉर्क से पेरिस तक काफी यात्राएँ शामिल थीं। एक प्रतीत होता समृद्ध परवरिश के बावजूद, पांडुलिपि क्यूरेटर और जीवनी लेखक डॉ. एलिजाबेथ गाऊ बताती हैं कि एनरीकेटा के पास शुरू में बहुत कम व्यक्तिगत संपत्ति थी और विक्टोरियन ब्रिटेन में उनकी क्यूबा की पहचान को 'कम प्रतिष्ठित' माने जाने के कारण उन्हें सामाजिक चुनौतियों का सामना करना पड़ा था।

उनका रास्ता तब बदल गया जब वह जॉन रिलैंड्स की दूसरी पत्नी मार्था की संगिनी बन गईं। जॉन रिलैंड्स एक अग्रणी लंकाशायर कपड़ा निर्माता और यकीनन ब्रिटेन के पहले स्वयं-निर्मित बहु-करोड़पति थे। अपनी तीव्र कार्य नैतिकता, मजबूत ईसाई धर्म और परोपकारी प्रयासों के लिए जाने जाने वाले जॉन रिलैंड्स एक मुखर दासता-विरोधी थे जो नैतिक, निष्पक्ष व्यापार-जैसी प्रथाओं का समर्थन करते थे। मार्था की मृत्यु के बाद, 75 वर्षीय जॉन ने 32 वर्षीय एनरीकेटा से विवाह कर लिया।

जॉन की मृत्यु के बाद, एनरीकेटा को उनकी अधिकांश विशाल संपत्ति विरासत में मिली, जो वर्तमान धन में अनुमानित £291 मिलियन पाउंड थी। उन्होंने इसका एक बड़ा हिस्सा मैनचेस्टर में लाइब्रेरी को बनवाने और उसके निर्माण के लिए समर्पित कर दिया, जो एक दस साल का कार्य था। डॉ. गाऊ एनरीकेटा के दृढ़ संकल्प वाले चरित्र पर प्रकाश डालती हैं, यह बताते हुए कि 1890 के दशक में एक महिला के रूप में उपेक्षा का सामना करने के बावजूद, उन्होंने अक्सर अपनी वित्तीय स्वतंत्रता का लाभ यह सुनिश्चित करने के लिए उठाया कि लाइब्रेरी के लिए उनकी योजनाएँ सफल हों।

जॉन रिलैंड्स लाइब्रेरी ने अपनी 'अद्भुत चीजों की कभी न खत्म होने वाली आपूर्ति' के साथ तेजी से प्रसिद्धि प्राप्त की, जिसने इस प्रचलित धारणा को चुनौती दी कि ऐसे महत्वपूर्ण सांस्कृतिक खजानों को केवल लंदन तक ही सीमित रहना चाहिए। एक सदी से भी अधिक समय बाद, यह मैनचेस्टर के केंद्र में ज्ञान के एक वैश्विक तीर्थस्थल के रूप में एनरीकेटा की स्थायी परोपकारी विरासत का प्रमाण है।",en,[],,How Cuban-born Enriqueta Rylands spent more than £100m to set up the John Rylands Library.,[''],www.bbc.com/culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Paradise It's difficult to discuss the power of this show without giving away the key twist that comes at the end of episode one. But safe to say, it turns what starts as a relatively conventional political thriller on its head. Sterling K Brown is the head of the US president's security detail, who finds himself accused of murder of his boss – but above and beyond the killing itself, not everything seems quite right with the world. Created by Dan Fogelman, the man behind the equally rug-pulling TV weepie This is Us, this is solid entertainment in the very best sense, with sharp plotting matched by some strong performances, from Brown’s tortured hero to Julianne Nicholson as a sinister tech billionaire. Plus, later on in the series, one particular episode which deals with truly monumental matters is simply breathtaking – but again, that's all that can be said without spoiling things for those yet to watch.

Wolf Hall: The Mirror and the Light The sumptuous conclusion to this adaptation of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall trilogy blends a beautifully shot escape into the luxurious past of Henry VIII's court with an evergreen depiction of the high personal cost of manoeuvring for power and influence. Mark Rylance is poignant as the king's advisor, Thomas Cromwell, who questions his own decisions, while the mercurial Henry is losing confidence in him. And Damian Lewis's fresh interpretation of Henry is dazzling, his voice and manner chillingly subdued even as he issues the most ruthless commands. Henry's wives come and go, but the unravelling bond between these men, and their opposite trajectories – Cromwell's self-doubts and decline and Henry's iron will that eliminates anyone in his way – shape the story. Written by Peter Straughn, a recent Oscar winner for his screenplay of Conclave, The Mirror and the Light is more resonant today than the original Mantel book was when it was published in 2020. It feels entirely relevant in a world where creeping authoritarianism is a global concern.

The Narrow Road to the Deep North Since breaking out in HBO teen drama Euphoria, rising star Jacob Elordi has chosen his roles well – but perhaps nothing has served him better so far than returning to his home country of Australia to play the protagonist in this searing war drama. An adaptation of Richard Flanagan's Booker Prize-winning novel, it explores the life of World War Two army surgeon Dorrigo Evans across three time periods: his stint stationed in Adelaide for military training, his hellish experiences as a prisoner of war in the Thai jungle, and then his existence as a professionally successful but emotionally deeply troubled veteran (now played by Ciarán Hinds), still unable to truly process the events of decades ago. Brought to impactful visual life by Justin Kurzel, known for his visceral studies of male violence on the big screen like Snowtown and The Order, it is simply one of the best evocations of the horrors of conflict that has been committed to screen. But at the same time, it takes as much care in its exploration of passion as violence, with the chemistry between Elordi's young Dorrigo and his uncle's wife Amy (a superb Odessa Young) burning up the screen. Given some of the scenes of sadistic brutality, it is of course a difficult watch, as it should be, but also one whose sheer artistry offers a kind of transcendence.

Your Friends and Neighbors Jon Hamm has never been better, expertly mixing comedy and drama in this series about a hedge-fund manager called Coop, who loses his job. He schemes to keep up appearances in his wealthy community, only to discover a new sense of himself. The show has a broad comic element, as Coop turns cat burglar, solving his financial problems by stealing luxury items from his neighbours. But the series is best in its bold take on what he calls in one of his mordant voiceovers, ""the quiet desperation of rich middle-aged men"", and in its depiction of his complicated relationships. He is still emotionally attached to his ex-wife (Amanda Peet), who left him for one of his friends, and struggles to connect with his two teenage children. He has a tender, supportive bond with his emotionally fragile sister (Lena Hall, a standout in the cast). Hamm hasn't had a role this rich since Don Draper in Mad Men, another flawed but sympathetic charmer who makes some wildly bad decisions, and defines the character so perfectly that it's hard to imagine anyone else at the centre of this sleek but penetrating series.

Big Boys It might have created a little less noise than Adolescence, but here is another British show about masculinity that really deserves to be seen. Jack Rooke's semi-autobiographical show about two university students who form an odd-couple friendship – nerdy gay man Jack and straight jack-the-lad Dan – has been an incredibly deft mix of laugh-out-loud humour, complete with delightfully niche pop culture references, and poignant drama – covering sexual awakening, depression, dementia and more besides – since it started in 2022. But this third and final series was undoubtedly its most powerful, kicking off with a hilarious episode on a package holiday in Greece but getting more serious as it continued, and handling Danny's spiralling mental health problems with particular skill. And boy, does Rooke know how to shatter audience hearts – the final episode is an emotional masterclass, including a significant cameo from the man himself. Here's hoping that it launches its extremely talented creator into the big time.

DJ Buxley said black DJs and artists too often appeared on smaller stages and are ""a bit of an afterthought"". He held the first Boxout Fest in 2023 to improve representation and offer new opportunities to musicians - this year more than 80 DJs debuted their sets at the annual festival. However, Buxley said: ""It's not just music, it's also the people that are doing the doors, the marketing, the social media, it's about putting on more people who are pushing black music and culture"". ""Anyone that's talented and pushing black music and culture, we give them the platform to be great."" The annual festival features music from genres including Afrobeats and Dancehall, with festival goers attending from as far as Ghana, Nigeria Bermuda, Italy and the United States. More than 6,000 people attended this year's two-day event which was held at the end of August. Boxout Fest also showcases female and non-binary DJs, who Buxley said were also under-represented. More than 6,000 festival goers from across the world attended Birmingham's Boxout Fest at the end of August ""I feel like festivals are no longer choosing people based on talent, but if you've got a hit song or the number of Instagram followers you have,"" the founder said. ""Whether it's Boxout Fest, a day party, a festival, or a live showcase, if you're talented we're going to spotlight you."" He added that representation was also dependent on promoters and called for diversification as well as changes to line-ups each year. Boxout presenter, Mel Grace, said people did not see a wide enough range of black music genres Mel Grace, one of Boxout's presenters, said she also wished larger UK festivals would highlight the many variations of black music and culture. ""There's so many people that came from the Windrush generation and second, third generations that are involved in [Birmingham's] culture, we want to represent ourselves as the Afrobeat's culture, the dance hall culture and so much more. Ms Grace added that as the UK's second city it was important for Birmingham to demonstrate the importance of black music and culture to other parts of the UK. ""We want to show that we're so proud of it."" Ms Grace said people did not see a wide enough range of black music genres, such as R&B, Rap and Amapiano, as large festivals did not feature them. ""There are so many different segments of black culture that don't get shown in the main festivals, so I'm glad we have Boxout as a platform."" NSG, who headlined this year's festival, stressed the importance of representing black British music and culture across UK festivals. ""Afrobeats is more than music, it's a culture and culture never dies,"" said Kruddz from the Hackney collective. ""Sometimes it's not about making money, true legacy is when you have an impact on people and feel like I have been able to do that,"" Buxley added. Follow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.","DJ Buxley founded Boxout Fest in 2023 to address the significant under-representation of Black DJs, artists, and diverse Black music genres at mainstream festivals. Buxley highlighted that Black performers are often relegated to smaller stages and treated as an ""afterthought,"" with talent frequently overlooked in favor of hit songs or social media following.

The annual festival aims to provide a crucial platform for talented musicians, including over 80 debut DJs, and also spotlights under-represented female and non-binary DJs. Boxout Fest's commitment to diversity extends beyond performers to include behind-the-scenes roles like marketing and social media, ensuring those who champion Black music and culture are empowered.

Showcasing a wide array of genres such as Afrobeats, Dancehall, R&B, Rap, and Amapiano, Boxout Fest attracts a global audience, with attendees from countries like Ghana, Nigeria, and the United States. Over 6,000 people attended this year's event in Birmingham, and another edition is scheduled for New York City from September 26-28.

Boxout presenter Mel Grace and headliners NSG echoed the sentiment, criticizing larger festivals for failing to showcase the rich diversity of Black culture and music. Buxley emphasized that the festival prioritizes lasting impact and legacy over financial gain, urging promoters to diversify line-ups and focus on talent to ensure authentic representation across the industry.","यहां अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद दिया गया है:

डीजे बक्सले ने मुख्यधारा के त्योहारों में अश्वेत डीजे, कलाकारों और विविध अश्वेत संगीत शैलियों के महत्वपूर्ण कम प्रतिनिधित्व को दूर करने के लिए 2023 में बॉक्सआउट फेस्ट (Boxout Fest) की स्थापना की। बक्सले ने इस बात पर प्रकाश डाला कि अश्वेत कलाकारों को अक्सर छोटे मंचों तक सीमित कर दिया जाता है और उन्हें ""बाद का विचार"" माना जाता है, जहाँ प्रतिभा को अक्सर हिट गानों या सोशल मीडिया पर उनके फॉलोअर्स के पक्ष में अनदेखा कर दिया जाता है।

यह वार्षिक महोत्सव प्रतिभाशाली संगीतकारों के लिए एक महत्वपूर्ण मंच प्रदान करने का लक्ष्य रखता है, जिसमें 80 से अधिक नवोदित डीजे शामिल हैं, और यह कम प्रतिनिधित्व वाली महिला तथा गैर-बाइनरी डीजे को भी प्रमुखता देता है। बॉक्सआउट फेस्ट की विविधता के प्रति प्रतिबद्धता केवल कलाकारों तक ही सीमित नहीं है, बल्कि मार्केटिंग और सोशल मीडिया जैसी पर्दे के पीछे की भूमिकाओं तक भी फैली हुई है, जिससे यह सुनिश्चित किया जा सके कि अश्वेत संगीत और संस्कृति का समर्थन करने वालों को सशक्त किया जाए।

अफ्रोबीट्स, डांसहॉल, आर एंड बी, रैप और अमापियानो जैसी शैलियों की एक विस्तृत श्रृंखला का प्रदर्शन करते हुए, बॉक्सआउट फेस्ट वैश्विक दर्शकों को आकर्षित करता है, जिसमें घाना, नाइजीरिया और संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका जैसे देशों के प्रतिभागी शामिल होते हैं। इस साल बर्मिंघम में हुए कार्यक्रम में 6,000 से अधिक लोग शामिल हुए, और इसका एक और संस्करण 26 से 28 सितंबर तक न्यूयॉर्क शहर में निर्धारित है।

बॉक्सआउट प्रस्तोता मेल ग्रेस और हेडलाइनर एनएसजी ने भी इस भावना का समर्थन किया, और बड़े त्योहारों की आलोचना की कि वे अश्वेत संस्कृति और संगीत की समृद्ध विविधता को प्रदर्शित करने में विफल रहे हैं। बक्सले ने जोर देकर कहा कि यह महोत्सव वित्तीय लाभ से कहीं अधिक स्थायी प्रभाव और विरासत को प्राथमिकता देता है। उन्होंने प्रमोटरों से आग्रह किया कि वे लाइन-अप में विविधता लाएं और प्रतिभा पर ध्यान केंद्रित करें ताकि पूरे उद्योग में प्रामाणिक प्रतिनिधित्व सुनिश्चित हो सके।",en,[],,Birmingham's Boxout Fest provides opportunities for DJs and artists pushing black music and culture.,[''],www.bbc.com/culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The TV love triangle that sparked a fan frenzy 2 days ago Share Save Megan Fisher Share Save Erika Doss/Prime Three series of The Summer I Turned Pretty have been building up to which brother Belly chooses ""Please tell me one of you watches The Summer I Turned Pretty???"" reads a text from one of my best friends in our group chat. We're both in our 30s, married, have busy careers, and yet we're hooked on a TV series about a teenage love triangle. The kind of obsession that involves shouting at the screen like it's a football match, and then taking a week to recover from the emotional turmoil. The third series of The Summer I Turned Pretty (TSITP) follows Isabel Conklin (Belly to her friends) as she makes what's expected to be her final decision about which brother - Conrad or Jeremiah Fisher - she will end up with. It's Prime Video's most popular show in the UK right now and social media is full of fan-made clips and opinions about whom she should choose. The much-anticipated finale airs on 17 September. Luckily, my friend and I are both Team Conrad. But the rivalry has got people so fired up that fans have been asked to calm down, as some of the cast have been abused online. So, what is it that's making us so emotionally invested in a romantic dilemma that doesn't even exist? Everyone loves a love triangle Erika Doss/Prime Conrad (in the black shirt) was Belly's first love, Jeremiah came later Love triangles aren't a new storytelling device. TSITP could be compared to throwback TV shows such as The Vampire Diaries and One Tree Hill (though the latter features half-brothers rather than full brothers like Conrad and Jeremiah). Warning: The below may contain potential spoilers - especially if you haven't watched series three of the show ""It very much [encapsulates] everything that was really good about 2000s romcoms and those angsty, yearning dramas,"" says fan Nathan Scott (no, not the One Tree Hill character). ""All the looks across the room, the forbidden little touches and everything - it's all there."" Nathan used to see his fiancee Oliwia Netter, both aged 25 and living in London, watching TSITP, and initially his attitude was ""this is rubbish and I'm not watching it"". But after he glimpsed more and began asking questions, Nathan admits he binge-watched the first series in three days. Nathan Scott Nathan credits fiancee Oliwia for introducing him to both Taylor Swift and TSITP Superfan Varun Lobo, 26, got into TSITP a couple of years ago but had not read any of the books, written by US author Jenny Han, on which the show is based. He agrees it builds on storytelling elements that have worked well before. ""It really kind of evokes a nostalgia that takes you back to your first teenage crushes and teenage romances,"" he says. Controversially, Varun is Team Jeremiah. Becca Kittler, 30, read the books as a teenager in the US and has been Team Conrad from the start. ""I think everyone has their person and I know that Conrad is Belly's. There's that spark, that tie they have with each other, the history."" Varun Lobo Varun is proud of his posters that he says bring a little bit of Cousins to Nottingham But isn't a love triangle involving brothers a bit much, even for fiction? ""At the end of the day, it's about escapism,"" Varun explains, pointing to how he feels about the current state of the world. ""Sometimes it's nice to just take yourself out of it and go to Cousins Beach."" Unafraid to discuss serious issues Michelle Elman, 32, is also an avid TSITP viewer and works as a life coach in London. Despite the show skipping over some of the moral quandaries that arise from dating a pair of brothers, she appreciates how it deals with significant issues. Death - a theme that also features in Dawson's Creek, another popular show from the turn of the millennium - hangs over the second and third series of TSITP. ""It has a lot of threads around grief, as the boys lose their mum, and so there are some really serious undertones to it,"" Michelle says. ""But they are presented in quite a digestible way - I think that's also where it's resonated with some people."" Michelle knows of mothers and daughters who watch the show together and use it as an opportunity to discuss how to deal with difficult situations - whether it be grief, dating problems or hurt feelings. There is plenty of this to go around: for example, when Jeremiah gets drunk and makes unpleasant comments, or when Conrad fails to communicate his feelings. The hype around TSITP has been fuelled by social media, particularly on TikTok where fans of the books speculate about the ending of the TV series. This became more frenzied when Han teased the series could end differently to the book. Others have created videos dedicated to the couple they'd like to see get together and many of these are set to songs by Taylor Swift, whose music features prominently in the show's soundtrack. Fans of Swift - who famously drops hidden messages and hints about future projects - have also become convinced Han has been planting seeds throughout the series to foreshadow the outcome. Erika Doss/Prime The bathtub scene - that's all","""The Summer I Turned Pretty"" (TSITP), the Prime Video series currently most popular in the UK, has ignited a widespread fan frenzy over its central teenage love triangle: Isabel ""Belly"" Conklin's choice between brothers Conrad and Jeremiah. This ""Team Conrad vs. Team Jeremiah"" debate has sparked intense emotional investment across age groups, leading to online voting campaigns, extensive social media discussion, and even instances of cast abuse, prompting calls for fans to calm down.

The show's appeal stems from its nostalgic evocation of 2000s rom-coms and angsty dramas, offering escapism and a relatable dive into first loves and teenage crushes. Beyond romance, TSITP also explores serious themes like grief (following the loss of the boys' mother) and relationship complexities in a digestible manner, making it a talking point for families. Social media, particularly TikTok, and a soundtrack heavily featuring Taylor Swift's music further amplify the show's virality and fan engagement, with theories abounding about potential plot twists. The highly anticipated third series finale, which is expected to see Belly make her final decision, is scheduled to air on September 17th, with speculation about a potential divergence from the original books further fueling excitement.","""द समर आई टर्न्ड प्रिटी"" (TSITP), जो प्राइम वीडियो की एक ऐसी सीरीज़ है जो वर्तमान में यूके में सबसे लोकप्रिय है, ने अपने केंद्रीय किशोर प्रेम त्रिकोण को लेकर प्रशंसकों में भारी उन्माद पैदा कर दिया है: इसमें इज़ाबेल ""बेली"" कॉंकलिन को भाइयों कॉनरैड और जेरेमिया में से किसी एक को चुनना है। ""टीम कॉनरैड बनाम टीम जेरेमिया"" की इस बहस ने सभी आयु वर्गों के लोगों में गहरा भावनात्मक जुड़ाव पैदा कर दिया है, जिसके परिणामस्वरूप ऑनलाइन वोटिंग अभियान, सोशल मीडिया पर व्यापक चर्चा और यहां तक कि कलाकारों के साथ दुर्व्यवहार की घटनाएं भी हुई हैं, जिसके कारण प्रशंसकों से शांत रहने का आग्रह किया जा रहा है।

शो की लोकप्रियता का कारण 2000 के दशक की रोमांटिक-कॉमेडी और भावनात्मक-नाटकों की पुरानी यादें ताजा करने वाला इसका अंदाज़ है, जो पलायनवाद और पहले प्यार तथा किशोरावस्था के आकर्षणों में आसानी से जुड़ने वाला अनुभव प्रदान करता है। रोमांस के अलावा, TSITP शोक (लड़कों की माँ के निधन के बाद उपजा) और रिश्तों की जटिलताओं जैसे गंभीर विषयों को भी सहज तरीके से उजागर करता है, जो इसे परिवारों के बीच चर्चा का विषय बनाता है। सोशल मीडिया, खासकर टिकटॉक, और टेलर स्विफ्ट के गानों से भरपूर साउंडट्रैक शो के वायरल होने और प्रशंसकों की भागीदारी को और बढ़ा देते हैं, जिसमें संभावित प्लॉट ट्विस्ट के बारे में ढेर सारे सिद्धांत सामने आ रहे हैं। बहुप्रतीक्षित तीसरे सीज़न का समापन एपिसोड, जिसमें बेली के अपने अंतिम निर्णय लेने की उम्मीद है, 17 सितंबर को प्रसारित होने वाला है। मूल किताबों से संभावित बदलाव के बारे में अटकलें इस उत्साह को और बढ़ा रही हैं।",en,[],,"The final episode of The Summer I Turned Pretty, which airs next week, should reveal which brother Belly will choose.",[''],www.bbc.com/culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here are some things its writers should – and shouldn't – do to accurately portray French culture. After three seasons of privileged mayhem in Maui, Sicily and Thailand, HBO's The White Lotus is now reported to be coming to France. But where? Given the series' history with Four Seasons properties, some sources point to the luxurious Grand Hôtel du Cap Ferrat on the pine-forested coastline of the Côte d'Azur as a possible contender, though the snowy Alpine retreat of Megève and even the swish George V in Paris are also in the running, according to Le Parisien. While HBO reps are keeping mum, there's one thing locals agree on: it's essential that the show get French culture right. For many travellers, the image of France conjures up visions of buttery croissants, cobblestone streets and runway-ready residents. These tropes are often reinforced by the nation's onscreen portrayal, as in the super-clean, fashion forward city of Emily in Paris. But France is more than just a few tired stereotypes.","Rumors are circulating that HBO's satirical series, *The White Lotus*, is set to film its next season in France, following previous installments in Maui, Sicily, and Thailand. While the exact location remains unconfirmed by HBO representatives, speculation points to the luxurious Grand Hôtel du Cap Ferrat on the Côte d'Azur, aligning with the show's history of featuring Four Seasons properties.

A major concern among locals and commentators is the show's accurate portrayal of French culture. There's a strong call for writers to move beyond common stereotypes—often reinforced by shows like *Emily in Paris*, depicting a super-clean, fashion-forward image—and instead present France as a diverse nation rich in art, literature, and music, reflecting its true complexity beyond mere croissants and cobblestone streets.","**HBO की सीरीज़ 'द व्हाइट लोटस' की अगली शूटिंग फ्रांस में, सांस्कृतिक चित्रण पर चिंताएं**

Mr Hall says he has spent three months working four or five yacht parties a week, followed by three or four club nights - while his mornings have been spent by the pool, soaking up the sun. Tom Hall Mr Hall used to work as an engineer but swapped his full-time job for a summer of music in Zante He had worked as a telecoms engineer since 2020 but said it had not been a difficult decision to switch jobs. Mr Hall explained he had always loved music and worked his way up from local bars to bigger clubs, with his music being played in the world-famous Ministry of Sound club. The DJ recalled the desperation in the early days of his music career, when he looked up a record label's address on a CD box, burnt his own music on to another and sent it to the address with a note that read ""play me"". ""It's a dream of mine that has come true - I've always wanted to go overseas and be the resident DJ on the boats and in the club nights,"" he said. ""It was an opportunity that I had to take with both hands."" He was previously the resident DJ of Sin in Worcester and Marilyn's in Evesham and said the Zante music scene had helped him to develop his skills. ""It's allowing me to play different genres in different settings,"" Mr Hall said. ""Because people are on holiday, I feel they've got an added bit of energy that you wouldn't get in a local nightclub back at home."" Tom Hall Mr Hall said pursuing music as a job had always been his dream After spending the summer months on the decks, Mr Hall is set to return to UK in October and will swap the sun for the student scene as he plans to DJ at university freshers' parties. He said he will most likely have to return to his day job after the party season - but now has a new goal. ""In 10 years the dream is to be headlining my own show or playing at a major festival in the UK or abroad such as Creamfields or Tomorrowland,"" he smiled.","**Newport Engineer Swaps Career for Dream DJ Residency in Zante**

Tom Hall, a former telecoms engineer from Newport, Shropshire, has traded his full-time career for a summer DJ residency on yachts and in clubs in Zante, Greece. Scouted during a holiday to the tourist hotspot, Hall, who had been an engineer since 2020, described the decision to pursue his long-held musical dream as an easy one.

Over three months, Hall has been working four to five yacht parties a week, followed by three to four club nights, all while enjoying sun-soaked mornings by the pool. He credits the Zante scene with helping him develop his skills by playing diverse genres to energetic holiday crowds. His musical journey began in local bars, with his tracks eventually featuring on shows like *Love Island* and *The Only Way is Essex*, and even played at the iconic Ministry of Sound. He recalled the early days of his career, when he would burn his own music onto CDs and send them directly to record labels.

While Hall is set to return to the UK in October to DJ at university freshers' parties and will likely resume his day job, he is also working on a solo album. His ultimate ambition is to headline his own shows or perform at major international festivals like Creamfields or Tomorrowland within the next decade.","**न्यूपोर्ट के इंजीनियर ने करियर छोड़ Zante में पाई सपनों की डीजे रेजीडेंसी**

न्यूपोर्ट, श्रॉपशायर के पूर्व टेलीकॉम्स इंजीनियर टॉम हॉल ने Zante, ग्रीस में याट और क्लबों में गर्मियों की डीजे रेजीडेंसी के लिए अपना पूर्णकालिक करियर छोड़ दिया है। इस पर्यटन स्थल पर छुट्टी के दौरान उनकी प्रतिभा को पहचाना गया था। हॉल, जो 2020 से इंजीनियर थे, ने अपने लंबे समय से संजोए संगीत के सपने को पूरा करने के फैसले को आसान बताया।

तीन महीनों में, हॉल हफ्ते में चार से पांच याट पार्टियों में डीजेिंग करते हैं, जिसके बाद तीन से चार क्लब नाइट्स होती हैं, और यह सब करते हुए वे पूल के किनारे धूप भरी सुबह का आनंद भी ले रहे हैं। उन्होंने Zante के माहौल को अपनी प्रतिभा निखारने का श्रेय दिया, जहाँ उन्हें ऊर्जावान छुट्टियों का आनंद ले रही भीड़ के लिए विभिन्न शैलियों का संगीत बजाना पड़ा। उनके संगीत का सफर स्थानीय बार से शुरू हुआ था, उनके ट्रैक अंततः *लव आइलैंड* और *द ओनली वे इज एसेक्स* जैसे शो में प्रसारित हुए, और यहां तक कि प्रतिष्ठित मिनिस्ट्री ऑफ साउंड में भी बजाए गए। उन्होंने अपने करियर के शुरुआती दिनों को याद किया, जब वे अपना संगीत सीडी पर रिकॉर्ड करते थे और सीधे रिकॉर्ड लेबल को भेजते थे।

हालांकि हॉल अक्टूबर में विश्वविद्यालय की फ्रेशर्स पार्टियों में डीजेिंग करने के लिए यूके लौटेंगे और संभवतः अपनी दिन की नौकरी फिर से शुरू करेंगे, वह एक सोलो एल्बम पर भी काम कर रहे हैं। उनकी अंतिम महत्वाकांक्षा अगले दशक के भीतर अपने खुद के शो में हेडलाइन करना या क्रीमफील्ड्स (Creamfields) या टुमॉरोलैंड (Tomorrowland) जैसे प्रमुख अंतरराष्ट्रीय त्योहारों में प्रदर्शन करना है।",en,[],,"After being offered DJing opportunities on a Greek island, Tom Hall is thinking of a music future.",[''],www.bbc.com/culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The self taught multi-instrumentalist rose from child poverty to international fame - with Miles Davis calling him the most ""important musician on the planet"". Hermeto Pascoal, the innovative Brazilian composer famed for his blend of jazz and traditional music, has died at the age of 89. The artist was primarily a pianist and flutist, but also played saxophone, guitars, drums, and accordions - and frequently incorporated household objects into his work. While recording his debut album Slaves Mass for Warner Brothers in 1976, he brought a pair of live pigs into the studio. Born on 22 June 1936 in a rural settlement north-east of Alagoas, he was unable to work outside with his family because of his albinism, and taught himself music while spending his days indoors. Aged 10, he began playing at dances and weddings, before going on to play forró and other traditional Brazilian music across the region. In the late 1950s, he moved to Rio de Janeiro and discovered the city's jazz scene, performing in nightclubs and joining a radio orchestra. His blend of jazz and traditional folk styles sparked the attention of Brazil's biggest stars in the genre. The singer Elis Regina performed with Pascoal, as did and percussionist Airto Moreira. The latter accompanied him on a tour to the US, where he was introduced to Miles Davis. But despite earning the respect of luminaries in the jazz world, Pascoal rejected the label as a jazz musician, and said he owed as much to Brazilian music like chorinho and samba. ""When they think I am doing one thing I am already doing something else... It's very liquid,"" he told Jazz World in 2022. Pascoal's family announced his death on his Instagram page on Saturday.

Trump has repeatedly threatened tougher measures against Moscow, but has so far failed to take any action when the Kremlin ignored his deadlines and threats of sanctions. In a post on his Truth Social platform, he said he was ""ready to do major sanctions on Russia"" once Nato nations had ""agreed, and started, to do the same thing"". US President Donald Trump has said he is ready to impose tougher sanctions on Russia, but only if Nato countries meet certain conditions which include stopping buying Russian oil. In what he called a letter to Nato nations, Trump said: ""I am ready to 'go' when you are. Just say when?"" He added ""the purchase of Russian oil, by some, has been shocking! It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia"". Trump also claimed the halt on Russian energy purchases, combined with heavy tariffs on China ""to be fully withdrawn"" after the war, would be of ""great help"" in ending the conflict. Europe's reliance on Russian energy has fallen dramatically since the start of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In 2022, the EU got about 45% of its gas from Russia. That is expected to fall to about 13% this year, though Trump's words suggest he feels that figure is not enough. The US president's message came during heightened tensions between Nato allies and Russia after more than a dozen Russian drones entered Polish airspace on Wednesday. Warsaw said the incursion was deliberate, but Moscow downplayed the incident and said it had ""no plans to target"" facilities in Poland. Denmark, France and Germany have joined a new Nato mission to bolster the alliance's eastern flank, and will move military assets eastwards. Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also made a demand to European nations over the purchase of Russian oil and gas. In an interview with ABC News, he said: ""We have to stop [buying] any kind of energy from Russia, and by the way, anything, any deals with Russia. We can't have any deals if we want to stop them."" Since 2022, European nations have spent around €210bn (£182bn) on Russian oil and gas, according to the think tank the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, much of which will have funded the invasion of Ukraine. The EU has previously committed to phasing out the purchases by 2028. The US want that to happen faster - partly by buying supplies from them instead. Trump's message was to Nato, not the EU, therefore including nations such as Turkey, a major buyer of Russian oil and a country that has maintained closer relations with Moscow that any other member of the alliance. Persuading Ankara to cut off Russian supplies may be a far harder task. Trump's most recent threat of tougher sanctions on Russia came earlier in September after the Kremlin's heaviest bombardment on Ukraine since the war began. Asked by reporters if he was prepared to move to the ""second phase"" of punishing Moscow, Trump replied: ""Yeah, I am,"" though gave no details. The US previously placed tariffs of 50% on goods from India - which included a 25% penalty for transactions with Russia that are a key source of funds for the war in Ukraine.","Former US President Donald Trump has declared he is prepared to impose significant sanctions on Russia, but only if NATO member nations first agree to cease all purchases of Russian oil. He condemned the continued acquisition of Russian energy as ""shocking,"" arguing it greatly weakens NATO's negotiating leverage over Moscow. Trump also suggested implementing substantial tariffs (50-100%) on China.

While Europe's reliance on Russian energy has dramatically decreased since the 2022 Ukraine invasion (from 45% of gas to an expected 13% this year), Trump believes current efforts are insufficient. European nations have spent an estimated €210 billion on Russian oil and gas since 2022, largely funding the war, with the EU previously committing to a phase-out by 2028. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has also urged a complete halt to all Russian energy and trade deals.

Trump's declaration comes amid heightened tensions between NATO and Russia, including recent Russian drone incursions into Polish airspace. However, his past threats of tougher measures against Moscow have often gone unfulfilled. Persuading all NATO members, particularly Turkey, which maintains closer ties with Moscow and is a major buyer of Russian oil, to comply with these conditions presents a significant challenge.","**हिंदी अनुवाद:**

ट्रंप की यह घोषणा नाटो और रूस के बीच बढ़ते तनाव के बीच आई है, जिसमें पोलिश हवाई क्षेत्र में हाल ही में रूसी ड्रोन की घुसपैठ भी शामिल है। हालांकि, मॉस्को के खिलाफ कड़ी कार्रवाई की उनकी पिछली धमकियां अक्सर पूरी नहीं हुई हैं। सभी नाटो सदस्यों, विशेष रूप से तुर्की को, जो मॉस्को के साथ घनिष्ठ संबंध रखता है और रूसी तेल का एक प्रमुख खरीदार है, इन शर्तों का पालन करने के लिए मनाना एक बड़ी चुनौती है।",en,[],,"The US president has repeatedly threatened tougher measures against Moscow, but has so far failed to take action.",[''],www.bbc.com/business,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prolonged petrol shortages, along with regular power cuts, the rising cost of living, hunger, poverty, inequality and youth unemployment, add to the tangible frustration here. The presidential, parliamentary and local council candidates are competing for votes against a background of cynicism about what might actually change. In a sign that money is tight, electioneering has been somewhat muted compared to the past. This is despite the presidential race being seen as a rematch between the incumbent, Lazarus Chakwera, and the man he beat in 2020, then-President Peter Mutharika. There are 15 other candidates. But the usual colourful campaign carnival is missing. The free T-shirts usually doled out with abandon to whip up enthusiasm are more limited. There are fewer giant election billboards on the nation's main roads. Back in the snaking petrol lines, patience runs thin, which has at times led to fist fights. BBC / AFP via Getty Images Peter Mutharika (L) and Lazarus Chakwera (R) have been political rivals for the past decade Sensing the fuel shortage was becoming an election issue, Chakwera has tried to tackle it head on. In a televised address, eight days before polls open, he acknowledged the frustration and apologised. The president then turned his fire on allegedly corrupt officials who he accused of deliberately sabotaging the oil market. Like fuel, new job opportunities are also hard to come by. To put food on the table, young men have been selling petrol and diesel using small plastic containers at five times the official price. In the southern town of Mangochi, they refused to be interviewed except to say, as they walked away, that preying on desperate motorists was the only way to survive. With food costs rising at more than 30% in the past year, and wages not keeping pace, things are becoming harder to afford. The high inflation rate has been partly put down to a shortage of foreign currency, which has forced some importers to buy US dollars on the more expensive black market. The costs have then been passed on to the consumer. The effect of the economic troubles on young people could be particularly significant in this election – as around half of registered voters are under the age of 35. And yet the two leading presidential candidates are considerably older. Chakwera is 70 and Mutharika is 85. ""When young people cast their ballots next week, they should think about the poverty crisis. The coming president should fix the employment rate because many of the young people are unemployed,"" said 33-year-old Monica Chinoko, who works in the capital, Lilongwe. Many younger voters have told the BBC that these continuous problems have dampened enthusiasm for the elections. ""Looking at the candidates - it's really a tough choice to make because hope has been lost. We've been voting and voting but things haven't gotten better,"" said Ashley Phiri, 35. ""But I'm hoping that this time around, the next leader will radically transform Malawi."" Supporters of opposition candidate Peter Mutharika argue that things were better when he was in State House Mutharika's election convoy has made several stops in the villages along the Bakili Muluzi highway. In one place, a supporter held up a sign saying ""back to state house"" and said life was better when the former president was in office. At a Mutharika rally in Machinga, an elderly woman wearing a colourful headscarf and sarong held up a huge bucket and shouted ""fertiliser"". What is at stake in Malawi's elections? 'I tell my children not to play so we save money on soap' She was highlighting the crucial issue for the 80% of the population who live in rural areas. Many of these people survive on what they grow on their smallholdings and make money from what is left over. Chakwera had promised to reduce the cost of the vital farming input – but the price has gone in the opposite direction. It is now six times more than it was in 2019. The president has ""accused some opposition parties of working with private traders to distort fertiliser prices"", his office said. He has pledged to smallholder farmers that the price will come back down under a targeted programme due to start next month. Supporters of Lazarus Chakwera are confident he will be re-elected Chakwera has had a tough five years at the helm but remains optimistic. He says he is investing in the future of the country and as a headline policy he has pledged that the state will deposit 500,000 Malawi kwacha ($290; £210) in individual accounts for every child born after the general election. They will be able to access it once they reach 18. Another former president, Joyce Banda – the country's only female head of state – is also running again. She has pledged to fight corruption, transform the economy and improve rural infrastructure. The other presidential candidates, including Atupele Muluzi, Dalitso Kabambe and current Vice-President Michael Usi, have all promised radical change in one of the world's poorest countries. There is no shortage of choice on the ballot paper, but Malawians will be hoping that whoever emerges as the winner – after Tuesday's vote or a possible second round – will be able to put more food on the table and more fuel in the tank.

Malawi is bracing for a crucial election where widespread economic hardship, particularly prolonged petrol shortages, threatens to overshadow the democratic process. The presidential race is a rematch between incumbent Lazarus Chakwera (70) and former president Peter Mutharika (85), alongside 15 other candidates, including former President Joyce Banda.

Beyond the severe fuel scarcity, which has led to long queues, fistfights, and black-market sales at five times the official price, Malawians grapple with frequent power cuts, a soaring cost of living (food prices up over 30% in the past year), high inflation, a foreign currency shortage forcing importers onto the black market, hunger, poverty, inequality, and pervasive youth unemployment. These persistent issues have fostered deep cynicism and dampened voter enthusiasm, with many feeling ""hope has been lost"" and ""things haven't gotten better"" despite continuous voting.

Campaigning for this election has been notably muted compared to previous years, with fewer traditional trappings like free T-shirts and giant billboards, indicating tight financial conditions. President Chakwera, in a televised address, apologized for the fuel crisis and blamed corrupt officials for market sabotage. He also faces scrutiny over a six-fold increase in fertilizer prices since 2019, despite earlier pledges to reduce costs, attributing price distortions to opposition parties and private traders. Chakwera has also promised a future investment scheme for children born after the election.

His rival, Mutharika, appeals to voters with claims that ""things were better"" during his previous tenure, particularly regarding essential agricultural inputs like fertilizer, which are crucial for the 80% of the population in rural areas.

A significant demographic factor is the youth vote, with half of registered voters under 35, who are disproportionately affected by job scarcity and rising costs, yet the leading candidates are considerably older. While other hopefuls promise radical change, combating corruption, and economic transformation, Malawian voters, presented with a wide array of choices, ultimately hope the next leader can address the fundamental challenges of putting ""more food on the table and more fuel in the tank.""","**मलावी का आगामी चुनाव: गंभीर आर्थिक कठिनाई और मतदाताओं की निराशा की छाया**

मलावी एक महत्वपूर्ण चुनाव की तैयारी कर रहा है, जहाँ व्यापक आर्थिक कठिनाई, विशेष रूप से लंबे समय से चली आ रही पेट्रोल की कमी, लोकतांत्रिक प्रक्रिया पर हावी होने की आशंका है। राष्ट्रपति पद की यह दौड़ मौजूदा राष्ट्रपति लाजरस चकवेरा (70) और पूर्व राष्ट्रपति पीटर मुथारिका (85) के बीच का दोबारा मुकाबला है, जिसमें पूर्व राष्ट्रपति जॉयस बांदा सहित 15 अन्य उम्मीदवार भी शामिल हैं।

गंभीर ईंधन संकट के अलावा, जिसके कारण लंबी कतारें, हाथापाई और आधिकारिक कीमत से पाँच गुना अधिक दाम पर काला बाजार में बिक्री हो रही है, मलावी के लोग बार-बार बिजली कटौती, जीवन-यापन की बढ़ती लागत (पिछले एक साल में खाद्य कीमतों में 30% से अधिक की वृद्धि हुई है), उच्च मुद्रास्फीति, विदेशी मुद्रा की कमी जो आयातकों को काला बाजार की ओर धकेल रही है, भूख, गरीबी, असमानता और व्यापक युवा बेरोजगारी से भी जूझ रहे हैं। इन लगातार बनी रहने वाली समस्याओं ने गहरी निराशा पैदा की है और मतदाताओं के उत्साह को कम किया है, जिसमें कई लोगों को लग रहा है कि लगातार मतदान के बावजूद ""आशा खो गई है"" और ""हालात बेहतर नहीं हुए हैं""।

इस चुनाव के लिए प्रचार अभियान पिछले वर्षों की तुलना में उल्लेखनीय रूप से शांत रहा है, जिसमें मुफ्त टी-शर्ट और विशाल होर्डिंग जैसे पारंपरिक दिखावे कम देखने को मिले हैं, जो कड़ी वित्तीय परिस्थितियों का संकेत है। राष्ट्रपति चकवेरा ने एक टेलीविजन संबोधन में ईंधन संकट के लिए माफी मांगी और बाजार में तोड़फोड़ के लिए भ्रष्ट अधिकारियों को जिम्मेदार ठहराया। उन्हें 2019 से उर्वरक की कीमतों में छह गुना वृद्धि पर भी जांच का सामना करना पड़ रहा है, जबकि उन्होंने पहले लागत कम करने का वादा किया था। उन्होंने मूल्य विकृतियों के लिए विपक्षी दलों और निजी व्यापारियों को जिम्मेदार ठहराया है। चकवेरा ने चुनाव के बाद पैदा होने वाले बच्चों के लिए भविष्य की निवेश योजना का भी वादा किया है।

उनके प्रतिद्वंद्वी, मुथारिका, मतदाताओं से यह दावा करके आकर्षित कर रहे हैं कि उनके पिछले कार्यकाल के दौरान ""हालात बेहतर थे"", खासकर उर्वरक जैसे आवश्यक कृषि इनपुट के संबंध में, जो ग्रामीण क्षेत्रों में 80% आबादी के लिए महत्वपूर्ण हैं।

एक महत्वपूर्ण जनसांख्यिकीय कारक युवा मतदाताओं का वोट है, जिसमें पंजीकृत मतदाताओं में से आधे 35 वर्ष से कम आयु के हैं, जो नौकरी की कमी और बढ़ती लागत से असमान रूप से प्रभावित हैं, फिर भी प्रमुख उम्मीदवार काफी अधिक उम्र के हैं। जबकि अन्य उम्मीदवार मौलिक परिवर्तन, भ्रष्टाचार से लड़ने और आर्थिक परिवर्तन का वादा करते हैं, मलावी के मतदाता, जिन्हें कई विकल्प दिए गए हैं, अंततः उम्मीद करते हैं कि अगला नेता ""लोगों की थाली में अधिक भोजन और उनकी गाड़ियों की टंकी में अधिक ईंधन"" सुनिश्चित करने जैसी बुनियादी चुनौतियों का समाधान कर सके।",en,[],,"With long petrol queues on city roads, everyday issues dominate in the run-up to Tuesday's vote.",[''],www.bbc.com/business,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Hostages and Missing Families Forum wrote on social media that Israel's strike on Qatar last week shows ""every time a deal approaches, Netanyahu sabotages it"". On Tuesday Israel attacked senior Hamas leaders meeting in a house in the Qatari capital Doha. The Palestinian armed group said five of its members and a Qatari security official were killed. On Sunday US Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrived in Israel for a visit during which he is due to meet Netanyahu as Israel faces international condemnation for the attack. Netanyahu said on Saturday that eliminating Hamas leaders in Qatar ""would rid the main obstacle"" to releasing the hostages and ending the war. He also accused Hamas of blocking all ceasefire attempts in order to drag out the war in Gaza. Hamas members had been in Doha to discuss the latest US proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza. However, families of the hostages described the Israeli PM's response as ""the latest excuse for failing to bring home"" their loved ones. ""The targeted operation in Qatar proved beyond any doubt that there is one obstacle to returning the 48 hostages and ending the war: Prime Minister Netanyahu,"" they said. ""The time has come to end the excuses designed to buy time so he can cling to power."" The group added that Netanyahu's ""stalling"" had cost ""the lives of 42 hostages and threatens the lives of additional hostages who are barely surviving"".

""Obviously we're not happy about it, the president was not happy about it. Now we need to move forward and figure out what comes next,"" Rubio said. He added that Trump's priority remains the return of all hostages and an end to the the war in Gaza. When asked whether the strike on Doha complicates Qatar's willingness to work with the US, Rubio said ""they've been good partners on a number of fronts"". Qatar is a key US ally in the region and the location of a major American air base. In the wake of the strike, Qatar condemned Israel's attack as ""cowardly"" and a ""flagrant violation of international law"". Netanyahu said the move was ""fully justified"" because it targeted senior Hamas leaders who organised the 7 October 2023 attacks. Meanwhile, Israeli forces have stepped up their assault on Gaza City with a wave of heavy air strikes, reducing entire apartment blocks and large concrete structures to rubble. Israel has also warned all residents in the region to leave immediately in anticipation of a huge ground offensive. Residents said the Israeli military has been targeting schools and makeshift shelters, often issuing warnings only moments before bombardments. On Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said about 250,000 people had left the city and moved south. Netanyahu's plan to occupy Gaza City has drawn international criticism, with the UN warning a military escalation in an area where famine has been declared will push civilians into an ""even deeper catastrophe"". On Sunday, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said the bodies of 68 people killed by the Israeli military had arrived at its hospitals over the previous day. Since UN-backed global food security experts confirmed a famine in Gaza City on 22 August, the ministry has reported that at least 144 people have died from starvation and malnutrition across the territory. Israel has said it is expanding its efforts to facilitate aid deliveries and has disputed the health ministry's figures on malnutrition-related deaths. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 64,871 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing intense criticism, particularly from families of hostages held by Hamas, who accuse him of being the primary obstacle to a deal for their loved ones' release. Hostage families stated that ""every time a deal approaches, Netanyahu sabotages it,"" and described his actions as ""excuses designed to buy time so he can cling to power,"" blaming his ""stalling"" for the deaths of 42 hostages.

This backlash follows an Israeli strike in Doha, Qatar, which targeted senior Hamas leaders meeting to discuss a US-backed ceasefire proposal. The attack killed five Hamas members and a Qatari security official and drew condemnation from Qatar as ""cowardly"" and a ""flagrant violation of international law."" Netanyahu, however, defended the strike as ""fully justified,"" arguing that eliminating Hamas leaders in Doha ""would rid the main obstacle"" to hostage release and ending the war. He also accused Hamas of blocking ceasefire attempts to prolong the conflict.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, visiting Israel, conveyed President Trump's unhappiness about the strike but affirmed strong US-Israeli ties, reiterating the US priority of hostage return and ending the Gaza war. Qatar, a key US ally and host to a major American air base, has been crucial in mediation efforts.

Meanwhile, the conflict in Gaza continues to escalate, with Israeli forces intensifying airstrikes on Gaza City, reducing large structures to rubble. Israel has warned residents to evacuate in anticipation of a major ground offensive, an operation the UN warns will push civilians into an ""even deeper catastrophe"" given a declared famine in Gaza City, where at least 144 people have died from starvation and malnutrition. The Hamas-run health ministry reports 68 deaths in one recent day, bringing the total killed in Israeli attacks to at least 64,871. The conflict began in response to Hamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which killed 1,200 people and resulted in 251 hostages.","यहाँ उस अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

**नेतन्याहू बंधक सौदे को ""बर्बाद"" करने के लिए भारी आलोचना का सामना कर रहे हैं; गाजा में संघर्ष तेज हुआ**

इज़राइली प्रधान मंत्री बेंजामिन नेतन्याहू को तीव्र आलोचना का सामना करना पड़ रहा है, विशेष रूप से हमास द्वारा बंधक बनाए गए लोगों के परिवारों की ओर से, जो उन पर अपने प्रियजनों की रिहाई के लिए एक समझौते में मुख्य बाधा होने का आरोप लगा रहे हैं। बंधक परिवारों ने कहा कि ""जब भी कोई समझौता करीब आता है, नेतन्याहू उसे बर्बाद कर देते हैं,"" और उनके कार्यों को ""सत्ता में बने रहने के लिए समय खरीदने के लिए गढ़े गए बहाने"" बताया। उन्होंने 42 बंधकों की मौत के लिए उनकी ""टालमटोल"" को जिम्मेदार ठहराया।

यह प्रतिक्रिया कतर के दोहा में एक इज़राइली हमले के बाद आई है, जिसने अमेरिकी समर्थित संघर्ष विराम प्रस्ताव पर चर्चा करने के लिए मिल रहे हमास के वरिष्ठ नेताओं को निशाना बनाया था। इस हमले में हमास के पांच सदस्य और एक कतरी सुरक्षा अधिकारी मारे गए, और कतर ने इसे ""कायरतापूर्ण"" तथा ""अंतर्राष्ट्रीय कानून का घोर उल्लंघन"" बताते हुए इसकी निंदा की। हालांकि, नेतन्याहू ने इस हमले को ""पूरी तरह से उचित"" बताते हुए बचाव किया। उन्होंने तर्क दिया कि दोहा में हमास के नेताओं को खत्म करना बंधकों की रिहाई और युद्ध समाप्त करने में ""मुख्य बाधा को दूर कर देगा""। उन्होंने हमास पर संघर्ष को लंबा खींचने के लिए संघर्ष विराम के प्रयासों को रोकने का भी आरोप लगाया।

इज़राइल के दौरे पर आए अमेरिकी विदेश मंत्री मार्को रुबियो ने हमले को लेकर राष्ट्रपति ट्रम्प की नाराजगी व्यक्त की, लेकिन मजबूत अमेरिकी-इज़राइली संबंधों की पुष्टि की, और बंधकों की वापसी तथा गाजा युद्ध को समाप्त करने की अमेरिकी प्राथमिकता को दोहराया। कतर, जो एक प्रमुख अमेरिकी सहयोगी और एक बड़े अमेरिकी हवाई अड्डे का मेजबान है, मध्यस्थता के प्रयासों में महत्वपूर्ण रहा है।

इस बीच, गाजा में संघर्ष लगातार बढ़ रहा है, इज़राइली सेना गाजा शहर पर हवाई हमलों को तेज कर रही है, जिससे बड़ी इमारतें मलबे में तब्दील हो गई हैं। इज़राइल ने एक बड़े जमीनी हमले की आशंका में निवासियों को निकालने की चेतावनी दी है। संयुक्त राष्ट्र चेतावनी देता है कि यह अभियान नागरिकों को ""और भी गहरी तबाही"" में धकेल देगा, खासकर गाजा शहर में घोषित अकाल को देखते हुए, जहां कम से कम 144 लोग भुखमरी और कुपोषण से मर चुके हैं। हमास द्वारा संचालित स्वास्थ्य मंत्रालय ने हाल ही के एक दिन में 68 मौतों की सूचना दी है, जिससे इजराइली हमलों में मारे गए कुल लोगों की संख्या कम से कम 64,871 हो गई है। यह संघर्ष 7 अक्टूबर को दक्षिणी इज़राइल पर हमास के हमले की प्रतिक्रिया में शुरू हुआ था, जिसमें 1,200 लोग मारे गए थे और 251 लोगों को बंधक बना लिया गया था।",en,[],,Their intervention comes as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrives in Israel to meet the Israeli PM.,[''],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The strike hit ""residential buildings housing several members of the Political Bureau of Hamas"", according to Qatari authorities. Within minutes, Israel said it was behind the blasts. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Shin Bet internal security service said in a statement that they conducted ""a precise strike targeting the senior leadership"" of Hamas. Later, Netanyahu and Defence Minister Israel Katz said Israeli security forces had been ordered on Monday to prepare for a possible strike ""after the murderous attacks in Jerusalem and Gaza"" – a reference to the killing of six Israelis by two Palestinian gunmen at a bus stop in Jerusalem and the killing of four Israeli soldiers in an attack on an army camp in Gaza City. ""The prime minister and the defence minister believed that the action was fully justified given the fact that it was this Hamas leadership that initiated and organised the October 7 massacre, and - since then - has not ceased from launching murderous operations against the State of Israel and its citizens,"" they added. Israeli media reported that the operation involved 15 Israeli fighter jets, firing 10 munitions against a single target within a few seconds.

The group named five members who it said were killed, including Khalil al-Hayya's son, Humam, and Jihad Labad, the director of Hayya's office. ""Targeting the negotiating delegation, as they discussed US President Donald Trump's latest proposal, confirms beyond doubt that Netanyahu and his government do not want to reach any agreement and are deliberately seeking to thwart all opportunities and thwart international efforts,"" it said. Hamas also said it held the US administration ""jointly responsible"" for the attack because of its support for the Israeli military. The White House said it was notified by the US military that Israel was attacking Hamas.

""However, eliminating Hamas, who have profited off the misery of those living in Gaza, is a worthy goal."" She added: ""President Trump immediately directed special envoy Steve Witkoff to inform the Qataris of the impending attack, which he did."" Afterwards, Trump spoke to Israel's prime minister, who told him that ""he wants to make peace and quickly"", according to Leavitt. The president also spoke to the emir and prime minister of Qatar and ""assured them that such a thing will not happen again on their soil"", she added. The Israeli prime minister's office earlier stressed that it was a ""a wholly independent Israeli operation"".

Qatar's government reacted with fury to Israel's actions, saying: ""This criminal assault constitutes a blatant violation of all international laws and norms, and poses a serious threat to the security and safety of Qataris and residents in Qatar.""

कतर, जो अमेरिका का एक प्रमुख सहयोगी और हमास तथा इजरायल के बीच अप्रत्यक्ष वार्ता में मध्यस्थ है, ने तुरंत इस हमले को ""कायरतापूर्ण"" और ""अंतर्राष्ट्रीय कानून"" तथा अपनी संप्रभुता का ""खुला उल्लंघन"" बताते हुए इसकी निंदा की। खाड़ी देश 2012 से हमास के राजनीतिक ब्यूरो की मेजबानी करता रहा है।

अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप ने इस घटना को ""दुर्भाग्यपूर्ण"" बताया, लेकिन दोहराया कि ""हमास का सफाया करना"" एक ""उचित लक्ष्य"" था। व्हाइट हाउस ने कहा कि उसे अमेरिकी सेना द्वारा आसन्न हमले के बारे में सूचित किया गया था, लेकिन यह भी कहा कि ""कतर, जो एक संप्रभु राष्ट्र और संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका का करीबी सहयोगी है, के अंदर एकतरफा बमबारी करना... इजरायल या अमेरिका के लक्ष्यों को आगे नहीं बढ़ाता है।"" राष्ट्रपति ट्रंप ने बाद में कथित तौर पर कतर को आश्वासन दिया कि ""ऐसी घटना उनकी धरती पर दोबारा नहीं होगी।""

हालांकि, इजरायली प्रधानमंत्री कार्यालय ने जोर देकर कहा कि यह एक ""पूरी तरह से स्वतंत्र इजरायली अभियान"" था और इसकी ""पूरी जिम्मेदारी"" ली। इजरायली प्रधानमंत्री बेंजामिन नेतन्याहू ने 7 अक्टूबर के हमले में हमास की भूमिका को देखते हुए इस हमले को ""पूरी तरह से उचित"" ठहराया।

इस हमले की अंतरराष्ट्रीय स्तर पर व्यापक निंदा हुई है। संयुक्त राष्ट्र महासचिव एंटोनियो गुटेरेस, सऊदी अरब, फ्रांस और यूके सभी ने कतर की संप्रभुता के उल्लंघन और आगे क्षेत्रीय वृद्धि की संभावना पर चिंता व्यक्त की है, खासकर ऐसे समय में जब कतर शांति प्रयासों में मध्यस्थता में एक महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभा रहा है।",en,[],,"Meanwhile, the White House says the Israeli strike ""does not advance Israel or America's goals"".",[''],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike earlier phases of the war, the current offensive has relied heavily on aerial bombardments, with entire apartment blocks and large concrete structures reduced to rubble. The intensification of strikes in recent days has triggered a surge in civilian displacement. Israel has warned all residents of Gaza City to leave immediately in anticipation of a huge ground offensive. On Saturday, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said about 250,000 people had left the city and moved south. It also said it had destroyed a high-rise building that it said had been used ""to advance and execute terrorist attacks"" against its troops. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the city is Hamas's last major stronghold. But the plan to occupy Gaza City has brought international criticism. The UN has warned an intensification of the offensive on an area where a famine has already been declared will push civilians into an ""even deeper catastrophe"". Gaza City is the largest urban centre in the territory and a historic heart of Palestinian political and social life. Residents say the Israeli military has been targeting schools and makeshift shelters, often issuing warnings only moments before bombardments. Many families have been forced to flee in darkness toward western Gaza. ""We escaped certain death, my husband, our three children and I,"" said Saly Tafeesh, a mother sheltering in the city. ""My brother died in my arms after being shot by a quadcopter drone. We ran in the dark to the west of Gaza."" The Israeli military has told residents to evacuate to the south of the territory - but many families say they cannot afford the journey, which costs up to $1,100 (£800). Hamas, meanwhile, has intensified its calls for residents to stay put and resist leaving the city. Rubein Khaled, a father-of-nine preparing to move south, expressed frustration. ""The Hamas preacher at Friday prayers accused anyone leaving Gaza City of being a coward running from the battlefield,"" he said. ""But why doesn't he tell Hamas leaders to surrender and release the Israeli hostages so this war can stop? We don't want to leave either, but we have no choice."" Israeli forces have not yet reached some eastern neighbourhoods that have remained largely intact since earlier raids in January, but the current campaign suggests they may now be seeking to dismantle entire districts. Reuters About quarter of a million people have left Gaza City, the Israeli military says Meanwhile, a Qatari foreign ministry spokesman strongly criticised Israel's prime minister in an interview with the BBC following this week's Israeli strike on Hamas officials in the Qatari capital Doha. Foreign Ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari told the BBC that the international community had ""to deal with a Netanyahu problem"". ""He is not somebody who is listening to anybody right now, who is listening to any reason, and we have to collectively stop him in his tracks,"" the official said. He argued the strike in Doha showed the Israeli leader ""never intended to sign any peace deal"" to end the war in Gaza and instead ""believes he can re-shape the Middle East in his own image"". Five of the group's members and a Qatari security officer were killed in Tuesday's strike - though the Palestinian armed group claimed no senior leaders had been killed. Hamas members had been in Doha to discuss the latest US proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza. Israel has faced widespread condemnation, including at the UN Security Council. Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel targeted the ""terrorist masterminds"" behind the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. Qatar's Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani earlier said that Qatar did not get advance warning of the strike, only receiving a call from a US official 10 minutes after the attack had started. On Friday, al-Thani had dinner with US President Donald Trump and his envoy Steve Witkoff in New York, having earlier met Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the White House. Rubio is travelling to Israel this weekend in a show of solidarity with Israel ahead of a UN meeting later this month at which France and the UK are expected to formally recognise a Palestinian state. Reuters The Israeli attack in Doha targeted Hamas officials discussing the latest US proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza","Israeli forces have significantly intensified their assault on Gaza City with heavy aerial bombardments, reducing entire apartment blocks to rubble and triggering a surge in civilian displacement. This escalation precedes a huge ground offensive, expected on Monday, for which Israel has issued warnings for all residents to evacuate immediately to the south.

The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) reported that approximately 250,000 people have already left Gaza City and moved south. However, residents describe fleeing ""certain death"" in darkness, often with minimal warning from the military, who they claim are targeting schools and makeshift shelters – a charge the IDF denies. The journey south is also reportedly costly, reaching up to $1,100 per family.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared Gaza City Hamas's ""last major stronghold,"" asserting that the group has lost control of the Gaza Strip. The IDF also stated it destroyed a high-rise used to ""advance and execute terrorist attacks.""

Conversely, Hamas has urged residents to stay and resist evacuation, creating a dilemma for many. Residents like Rubein Khaled express frustration, feeling forced to leave despite Hamas's calls and accusations of cowardice from preachers.

The intensified offensive has drawn widespread international criticism. The UN has warned that intensifying the offensive in an area already facing famine will push civilians into an ""even deeper catastrophe."" Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman, Majed Al-Ansari, sharply criticized Netanyahu, stating he ""is not listening to anybody right now"" and suggesting the international community must ""collectively stop him."" The plan to occupy Gaza City has also been condemned by the U.S. and the European Union, and Israel has faced widespread criticism at the UN Security Council.

Further complicating diplomatic efforts, Israel recently conducted a strike in Doha targeting Hamas officials who were discussing a US-backed ceasefire proposal for Gaza. Five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer were killed. Qatar's Prime Minister stated he received only 10 minutes' advance warning from a US official. Netanyahu justified the strike as targeting ""terrorist masterminds"" behind the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.","यहां अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

इज़राइली सेना ने गाजा शहर पर अपने हमले को भारी हवाई बमबारी के साथ काफी तेज कर दिया है, जिससे पूरी-पूरी अपार्टमेंट इमारतें मलबे में बदल गई हैं और नागरिकों के विस्थापन में भारी वृद्धि हुई है। यह वृद्धि एक बड़े जमीनी हमले से पहले हुई है, जिसकी सोमवार को उम्मीद है, और जिसके लिए इज़राइल ने सभी निवासियों को तुरंत दक्षिण की ओर खाली करने की चेतावनी जारी की है।

इज़राइली रक्षा बलों (IDF) ने बताया कि लगभग 2.5 लाख लोग पहले ही गाजा शहर छोड़ कर दक्षिण चले गए हैं। हालांकि, निवासी अंधेरे में ""निश्चित मौत"" से भागने का वर्णन करते हैं, अक्सर सेना से न्यूनतम चेतावनी के साथ, जिनका वे दावा करते हैं कि वे स्कूलों और अस्थायी आश्रयों को निशाना बना रहे हैं – एक आरोप जिसका IDF खंडन करता है। दक्षिण की यात्रा कथित तौर पर महंगी भी है, जो प्रति परिवार $1,100 तक पहुँच जाती है।

प्रधान मंत्री बेंजामिन नेतन्याहू ने गाजा शहर को हमास का ""अंतिम प्रमुख गढ़"" घोषित किया है, दावा करते हुए कि समूह ने गाजा पट्टी पर नियंत्रण खो दिया है। IDF ने यह भी कहा कि उसने एक ऊंची इमारत को नष्ट कर दिया है जिसका उपयोग ""आतंकवादी हमलों को आगे बढ़ाने और अंजाम देने"" के लिए किया जाता था।

इसके विपरीत, हमास ने निवासियों से रुकने और खाली करने का विरोध करने का आग्रह किया है, जिससे कई लोगों के लिए दुविधा पैदा हो गई है। रुबीन खालिद जैसे निवासी हमास की अपीलों और धर्मोपदेशकों द्वारा कायरता के आरोपों के बावजूद खुद को छोड़ने के लिए मजबूर महसूस करते हुए निराशा व्यक्त करते हैं।

तेज हुए हमले की व्यापक अंतरराष्ट्रीय आलोचना हुई है। संयुक्त राष्ट्र ने चेतावनी दी है कि पहले से ही अकाल का सामना कर रहे क्षेत्र में हमले को तेज करने से नागरिक ""और भी गहरी तबाही"" में धकेल दिए जाएंगे। कतर के विदेश मंत्रालय के प्रवक्ता, माजेद अल-अंसारी ने नेतन्याहू की कड़ी आलोचना की, यह कहते हुए कि वह ""इस समय किसी की नहीं सुन रहे हैं"" और सुझाव दिया कि अंतर्राष्ट्रीय समुदाय को ""सामूहिक रूप से उन्हें रोकना"" चाहिए। गाजा शहर पर कब्जा करने की योजना की अमेरिका और यूरोपीय संघ ने भी निंदा की है, और इज़राइल को संयुक्त राष्ट्र सुरक्षा परिषद में व्यापक आलोचना का सामना करना पड़ा है।

राजनयिक प्रयासों को और जटिल करते हुए, इज़राइल ने हाल ही में दोहा में एक हमला किया जिसमें हमास के अधिकारियों को निशाना बनाया गया जो गाजा के लिए अमेरिका समर्थित युद्धविराम प्रस्ताव पर चर्चा कर रहे थे। इस हमले में पांच हमास सदस्य और एक कतरी सुरक्षा अधिकारी मारे गए। कतर के प्रधान मंत्री ने कहा कि उन्हें एक अमेरिकी अधिकारी से केवल 10 मिनट पहले चेतावनी मिली थी। नेतन्याहू ने हमले को 7 अक्टूबर 2023 के इज़राइल पर हमास हमले के पीछे ""आतंकवादी सरगनाओं"" को निशाना बनाने के रूप में उचित ठहराया।",en,[],,A wave of heavy aerial attacks in recent days have triggered a surge in civilian displacement.,[''],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I met him in a house not far from the building that Israel attacked on Tuesday afternoon. From the beginning of the war in Gaza, al-Hayya had been the chief Hamas negotiator, sending and receiving messages to the Israelis and Americans via Qatari and Egyptian intermediaries. At moments where ceasefires were thought likely, al-Hayya, along with the men who were also targeted this afternoon, were only a short distance from the Israeli and American delegations. When they were attacked, al-Hayya and the other top Hamas leaders were discussing the latest American diplomatic proposals to end the war in Gaza and free the remaining Israeli hostages. Israel's swift declaration of what it had done immediately fuelled speculation on social media that the latest American proposals were simply a ruse to get the Hamas leadership in one place where they could be targeted. On 3rd October last year, as Khalil al-Hayya walked into the venue for our meeting in a modest, low-rise villa, I was surprised that he had so little security. We had to give up our phones, and a couple of bodyguards came with him into the house. Outside plain clothes Qatari police sat smoking in an SUV. That was it. A hundred bodyguards could not have stopped an air strike, but al-Hayya and his people were relaxed and confident. The point was that Qatar was supposed to be safe, and they felt secure enough to move around relatively openly. A few months earlier, on 31 July 2024, Israel had assassinated Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas political leader in Tehran, where he was attending the inauguration of President Masoud Pezeshkian. With the war in Gaza raging, I had wondered whether it might be dangerous to sit in the same room as Khalil al-Hayya. But like him, I thought Qatar was off limits. In the last few decades Qatar has tried to carve itself a position as the Switzerland of the Middle East, a place where even enemies could make deals. The Americans negotiated with the Afghan Taliban in Doha. And in the almost two years since the attacks on 7th October 2023, Qatar has been the centre of the diplomatic efforts to negotiate ceasefires and perhaps even an end to the war. The peace efforts, driven by President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, were faltering badly. But now they are in ruins. In the words of one senior western diplomat ""there is no diplomacy."" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told Israelis that their enemies will never be able to sleep easy and are paying the price for ordering the 7th October attacks. Reuters Hamas leader and chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya","Israel has conducted an airstrike in Doha, Qatar, killing Khalil al-Hayya, Hamas's chief negotiator, and other senior leaders. The attack occurred while they were reportedly discussing the latest American proposals to end the war in Gaza, fuelling immediate speculation that these diplomatic efforts might have been a ruse to lure the leadership into a targeted location.

This strike has profoundly damaged Qatar's long-standing reputation as a neutral mediator, often called the ""Switzerland of the Middle East,"" which had been central to negotiating ceasefires in Gaza and other significant peace talks, like those between the US and the Afghan Taliban. Previously, al-Hayya and other Hamas figures moved with relatively little security in Qatar, reflecting the perceived safety and neutrality of the host nation, which has now been severely compromised.

The incident follows the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran on July 31, 2024. With ceasefire efforts now described as ""in ruins"" by one senior Western diplomat, who stated ""there is no diplomacy,"" the attack marks a significant blow to any prospects of a diplomatic resolution. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated that Israel's enemies would ""never be able to sleep easy,"" linking the strike to accountability for the October 7 attacks.","इज़राइल ने कतर के दोहा में हवाई हमला किया है, जिसमें हमास के मुख्य वार्ताकार खलील अल-हय्या और अन्य वरिष्ठ नेता मारे गए हैं। यह हमला उस वक्त हुआ जब वे कथित तौर पर गाजा युद्ध समाप्त करने के नवीनतम अमेरिकी प्रस्तावों पर चर्चा कर रहे थे, जिससे तुरंत यह अटकल लगने लगी कि ये राजनयिक प्रयास नेतृत्व को एक लक्षित स्थान पर लुभाने की एक चाल हो सकते हैं।

इस हमले ने कतर की लंबे समय से चली आ रही तटस्थ मध्यस्थ की प्रतिष्ठा को गहराई से नुकसान पहुंचाया है, जिसे अक्सर 'मध्य पूर्व का स्विट्जरलैंड' कहा जाता था। इस देश ने गाजा में संघर्ष विराम वार्ताओं और अमेरिका तथा अफगान तालिबान के बीच हुई वार्ताओं जैसी अन्य महत्वपूर्ण शांति वार्ताओं में केंद्रीय भूमिका निभाई थी। पहले, अल-हय्या और हमास के अन्य नेता कतर में अपेक्षाकृत कम सुरक्षा के साथ आते-जाते थे, जो मेजबान राष्ट्र की कथित सुरक्षा और तटस्थता को दर्शाता था। अब यह स्थिति गंभीर रूप से खतरे में पड़ गई है।

यह घटना 31 जुलाई, 2024 को तेहरान में हमास के राजनीतिक नेता इस्माइल हनियेह की हत्या के बाद हुई है। एक वरिष्ठ पश्चिमी राजनयिक द्वारा संघर्ष विराम प्रयासों को 'खंडहर' बताए जाने और 'कोई कूटनीति नहीं' होने की बात कहने के बाद, यह हमला किसी भी राजनयिक समाधान की संभावनाओं के लिए एक महत्वपूर्ण झटका है। इज़राइली प्रधान मंत्री बेंजामिन नेतन्याहू ने दोहराया कि इज़राइल के दुश्मन 'कभी चैन की नींद नहीं सो पाएंगे' और इस हमले को 7 अक्टूबर के हमलों की जवाबदेही से जोड़ा।",en,[],,"The Doha attack signals that Benjamin Netanyahu will press forward hard on all fronts, writes Jeremy Bowen.",[''],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Israeli media reported the operation involved 15 Israeli fighter jets, which fired 10 munitions against a single target. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he authorised the strike and there would be ""no immunity"" for Hamas leaders. In his statement on Tuesday, President Trump issued a rare rebuke of Netanyahu. ""Unilaterally bombing inside Qatar, a Sovereign Nation and close Ally of the United States, that is working very hard and bravely taking risks with us to broker Peace, does not advance Israel or America's goals,"" he wrote. In later remarks, Trump said he was ""very unhappy about the way that it went down"", telling reporters: ""I'm not thrilled about the whole situation."" He called for the return of Israeli hostages held by Hamas and said he would issue ""a full statement"" on Wednesday, adding: ""I'm never surprised by anything. Especially when it comes to the Middle East"". White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier that ""The president also spoke to the emir and prime minister of Qatar and thanked them for their support and friendship to our country."" ""He assured them that such a thing will not happen again on their soil,"" she added. Trump's post said, however, that ""eliminating Hamas, who have profited off the misery of those living in Gaza, is a worthy goal"" and reiterated that he wants ""ALL of the hostages, and the bodies of the dead released and this War to END, NOW!"". The attack took place on early Tuesday afternoon, with footage showing a badly damaged building in Doha. Qatar's foreign ministry condemned the strike ""in the strongest possible terms,"" and said the attack was a ""blatant violation"" of international law. It later said that Qatari officials were not notified of the Israeli strike ahead of time. ""The communication received from one of the US officials came during the sound of explosions,"" said Qatar's foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al-Ansari in a post on X. Qatar has hosted Hamas's political bureau since 2012 and played a key role in facilitating indirect negotiations between the group and Israel since the 7 October attacks. It has also been a close ally of the US. Around 10,000 American troops are stationed at a US airbase in al-Udeid, just outside Doha. In May, Trump announced a ""historic"" economic agreement signed between the two countries that he said is valued at least $1.2 trillion (£890bn). Qatar has also recently gifted Trump a plane - valued at $400m - as an ""unconditional gift"" to be used as the new Air Force One, the official aircraft of the US president.","An Israeli airstrike targeting Hamas senior leaders in Doha, Qatar, reportedly killed six people, including a Qatari security forces member.

Trump, who claimed he was notified too late by the US military to stop the attack, praised Qatar as a ""strong ally and friend."" The White House later assured Qatari officials that such an incident would not recur on their soil. While affirming the worthy goal of eliminating Hamas and securing hostages, Trump expressed deep displeasure over the operation.

ब्रिटेन ने गाजा से गंभीर रूप से बीमार और घायल फिलिस्तीनी बच्चों की निकासी शुरू कर दी है, जिसका पहला समूह आने वाले दिनों में एनएचएस (राष्ट्रीय स्वास्थ्य सेवा) में इलाज के लिए पहुंचने की उम्मीद है। विदेश सचिव यवेट कूपर ने इस अभियान की पुष्टि करते हुए बताया कि उनकी रवानगी सुनिश्चित करने के लिए ""बहुत सारे राजनयिक कार्य"" शामिल थे। यह पहली बार है जब यूके सरकार ने अपनी समर्पित योजना के तहत बच्चों को निकाला है, हालांकि कुछ पहले निजी तौर पर आ चुके हैं।

हालांकि कूपर ने सटीक संख्या की पुष्टि नहीं की, लेकिन बीबीसी की जानकारी के अनुसार शुरुआती समूह में 30 से 50 बच्चे शामिल हैं, जिनके साथ परिवार के सदस्य भी हो सकते हैं। यह प्रयास विदेश, राष्ट्रमंडल और विकास कार्यालय, गृह कार्यालय और स्वास्थ्य विभाग की एक संयुक्त पहल है। यूके सरकार छात्रों को निकालने पर भी काम कर रही है और मध्य पूर्व संकट के लिए एक व्यापक समाधान तलाश रही है।

यह निकासी गाजा में गंभीर मानवीय संकट की पृष्ठभूमि में हो रही है। हमास-प्रशासित स्वास्थ्य मंत्रालय की रिपोर्ट के अनुसार, 22 अगस्त को गाजा सिटी में अकाल की पुष्टि होने के बाद से कम से कम 142 मौतें हुई हैं। विश्व स्वास्थ्य संगठन (डब्ल्यूएचओ) का कहना है कि इजरायल के हमले ने क्षेत्र की स्वास्थ्य प्रणाली को ""बर्बादी की हद तक"" खींच दिया है। इजरायल, जो स्वास्थ्य मंत्रालय के आंकड़ों पर विवाद करता है और कहता है कि वह सहायता प्रयासों का विस्तार कर रहा है, ने 7 अक्टूबर, 2023 को हमास के नेतृत्व वाले हमले के जवाब में अपना अभियान शुरू किया था, जिसमें लगभग 1,200 लोग मारे गए थे और 251 लोगों को बंधक बना लिया गया था। तब से, गाजा स्वास्थ्य मंत्रालय की रिपोर्ट है कि इजरायली हमलों में कम से कम 64,803 लोग मारे गए हैं।",en,[],,"The Foreign Office says the group of children will arrive in the UK ""in the coming days"".",[''],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the incursion could not be a mistake - it was ""an obvious expansion of the war by Russia"". Moscow has not commented on the Romanian claims. Romanian fighter jets were in the air monitoring a Russian attack in Ukraine on Saturday and were able to track the drone near Ukraine's southern border, the defence ministry said in a statement. Romania says a Russian drone has breached its airspace - the second Nato country to report such an incursion. In its statement, Romania's defence ministry said it detected the Russian drone when two F-16 jets were monitoring the country's border with Ukraine, after ""Russian air attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure on the Danube"". The drone was detected 20km (12.4 miles) south-west of the village of Chilia Veche, before disappearing from the radar. But it did not fly over populated areas or pose imminent danger, the ministry said. The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, called the incident ""yet another unacceptable breach of an EU member state's sovereignty"". Poland also responded to concerns over Russian drones on Saturday. ""Preventative operations of aviation - Polish and allied - have begun in our airspace,"" Prime Minister Donald Tusk said in a post on X. ""Ground-based air defence systems have reached the highest state of readiness."" Earlier this week Russia's defence ministry said there had been ""no plans"" to target facilities on Polish soil. Belarus, a close Russian ally, said the drones which entered Polish airspace on Wednesday were an accident, after their navigation systems were jammed. On Sunday, the Czech Republic announced it had sent a special operations helicopter unit to Poland. The unit consists of three Mi-171S helicopters, each one capable of transporting up to 24 personnel and featuring full combat equipment. The move is in response to Russian's incursion into Nato's eastern flank, the Czech Defence Minister Jana Cernochova said. In response to the latest drone incursion, President Zelensky said the Russian military ""knows exactly where their drones are headed and how long they can operate in the air"". He has consistently asked Western countries to tighten sanctions on Moscow. US President Donald Trump also weighed in on airspace breach earlier this week, saying he was ""ready"" to impose tougher sanctions on Russia, but only if Nato countries met certain conditions, such as stopping buying Russian oil. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has been making slow progress in the battlefield. Trump has been leading efforts to end the war, but Russia has intensified attacks on Ukraine since President Vladimir Putin returned from a summit with Trump in Alaska last month.","Romania has become the second NATO country to report a Russian drone incursion into its airspace, after its F-16 aircraft detected an unmanned aerial vehicle while monitoring the border with Ukraine. The drone was identified near the village of Chilia Veche, during Russian air attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure on the Danube, but disappeared from radar without flying over populated areas or posing immediate danger.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the incident, stating it could not be a mistake and represented ""an obvious expansion of the war by Russia."" Moscow has not commented on Romania's claims, though Russia's defence ministry had previously denied plans to target Polish soil after similar drone concerns there. Belarus, a close Russian ally, attributed past drone incursions into Polish airspace to accidental navigation system jamming.

The EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, called the incident ""yet another unacceptable breach of an EU member state's sovereignty."" In response to heightened concerns over Russian drone activity on NATO's eastern flank, Poland has launched ""preventative operations"" with its own and allied aviation, putting ground-based air defence systems on high alert. The Czech Republic also deployed a special operations helicopter unit to Poland in support.

Zelensky has consistently urged Western countries to tighten sanctions on Russia, asserting that the Russian military ""knows exactly where their drones are headed."" Earlier, former US President Donald Trump had indicated a willingness to impose tougher sanctions on Russia under certain conditions.

यूक्रेन के राष्ट्रपति वोलोदिमीर ज़ेलेंस्की ने इस घटना की निंदा करते हुए कहा कि यह कोई गलती नहीं हो सकती और यह ""रूस द्वारा युद्ध का स्पष्ट विस्तार"" है। मॉस्को ने रोमानिया के दावों पर कोई टिप्पणी नहीं की है, हालांकि रूस के रक्षा मंत्रालय ने इससे पहले पोलिश धरती पर इसी तरह की ड्रोन चिंताओं के बाद पोलैंड को निशाना बनाने की योजनाओं से इनकार किया था। रूस के करीबी सहयोगी बेलारूस ने पोलिश हवाई क्षेत्र में पिछली ड्रोन घुसपैठ को आकस्मिक नेविगेशन सिस्टम जैमिंग के कारण बताया था।

यूरोपीय संघ (EU) की विदेश नीति प्रमुख, काजा कल्लास ने इस घटना को ""एक यूरोपीय संघ सदस्य देश की संप्रभुता का एक और अस्वीकार्य उल्लंघन"" बताया। नाटो के पूर्वी किनारे पर रूसी ड्रोन गतिविधि को लेकर बढ़ती चिंताओं के जवाब में, पोलैंड ने अपने और सहयोगी देशों के विमानन के साथ ""निवारक अभियान"" शुरू किए हैं, और अपने जमीनी हवाई रक्षा प्रणालियों को हाई अलर्ट पर रखा है। चेक गणराज्य ने भी समर्थन में पोलैंड में एक विशेष अभियान हेलीकॉप्टर इकाई तैनात की है।

ज़ेलेंस्की ने लगातार पश्चिमी देशों से रूस पर प्रतिबंध कड़े करने का आग्रह किया है, यह दावा करते हुए कि रूसी सेना ""ठीक से जानती है कि उनके ड्रोन कहाँ जा रहे हैं।"" इससे पहले, अमेरिका के पूर्व राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप ने कुछ शर्तों के तहत रूस पर कड़े प्रतिबंध लगाने की इच्छा जताई थी। ये घटनाएँ ऐसे समय में हो रही हैं जब रूस का यूक्रेन पर फरवरी 2022 में शुरू किया गया पूर्ण पैमाने का आक्रमण जारी है।",en,[],,"Ukraine's President Zelensky called the incursion ""an obvious expansion of the war by Russia"".",[''],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yarova is to the north of Slovyansk, one of the big cities in the region, and only a few kilometres from the front line as Russian forces advance slowly in the east. The victims were ""ordinary civilians"" collecting their pensions in Yarova, Donetsk region, said President Volodymyr Zelensky. Regional head Vadym Filashkin said emergency services were working at the scene, urging residents to ""evacuate to safer regions"". Twenty-four people have been killed and 19 injured in a Russian air strike on a village in eastern Ukraine, local officials say. Twenty-three people were killed in overnight air strikes on Ukraine's capital Kyiv at the end of August.

The head of the local administration in the nearby city of Lyman, Oleksandr Zhuravlyov, told Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne that the attack took place at about 10:40 local time (07:40 GMT) on Tuesday, as pensions were being handed out. He said most of the victims were elderly people. Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko later said Russia ""dropped a guided air bomb"" on the village. Pictures from the scene showed a badly damaged Ukrainian postal service vehicle of the type used to distribute pensions. The head of the Ukrposhta service said the vehicle had been parked under trees as a security measure and a local postal official had been wounded in the attack. ""Maybe someone gave away the co-ordinates,"" he speculated. Yarova sits on a key railway line between the cities of Lyman and Izium. It is also only about 6km (3.7 miles) away from the next village of Novoselivka, where Russian forces are closing in on the outskirts. Zhuravlyov told Suspilne they had to work out how the postal service could continue to hand out pensions: ""Because the front line is less than 10km away, we will 'move away' all these payments, so they can have their pensions in safer places."" Local officials said 22 people had already been evacuated from the area.

Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko stated Russia used a ""guided air bomb"" in the strike, which occurred around 10:40 local time.

राष्ट्रपति वलोडिमिर ज़ेलेंस्की ने हमले के बाद के भयानक फुटेज पोस्ट किए, हमले के लिए ""कोई शब्द नहीं"" होने की बात कहते हुए दुनिया से चुप न रहने का आग्रह किया और अमेरिका, यूरोप तथा जी-20 देशों से प्रतिक्रिया की मांग की। क्षेत्रीय प्रमुख वादिम फिलाशकिन ने निवासियों से इलाके खाली करने का आग्रह किया, और आपातकालीन सेवाओं को तैनात किया गया। यूक्रेन की डाक सेवा, उक्रपोश्ता (Ukrposhta), के प्रमुख ने आशंका जताई कि हमलावरों को निर्देशांक दिए गए हो सकते हैं और अग्रिम पंक्ति क्षेत्र में पेंशन वितरण जारी रखने पर चिंता व्यक्त की।

Sunday's strikes killed four people, including a mother and her baby, and damaged Ukraine's main government building in Kyiv for the first time. The attack - which Ukraine said involved at least 810 drones and 13 missiles - has led to growing calls for stronger Western action against President Vladimir Putin. Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Monday that no sanctions would ever be able to force Russia to ""change the consistent position that our president has repeatedly spoken about"". Speaking to reporters after the bombardment, the US president said he was ""not happy with the whole situation."" Trump has previously threatened harsher measures against Russia, but not taken any action when Putin ignored his deadlines and threats of sanctions. Asked on on Sunday if he was prepared to move to the ""second phase"" of punishing Moscow, Trump replied: ""Yeah, I am,"" though gave no details. The threat follows remarks from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said Washington was prepared to escalate economic pressure but needed stronger European backing. In an interview with NBC, Bessent said that, if EU nations increased sanctions and secondary tariffs on countries which buy Russian oil, ""the Russian economy will be in total collapse, and that will bring President Putin to the table"". He added: ""We are in a race now between how long can the Ukrainian military hold up, versus how long can the Russian economy hold up."" So far, Washington's most aggressive measure has been a 50% tariff on imports from India, imposed last month in response to Delhi's continued purchases of Russian oil.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent elaborated that Washington is ready to escalate economic pressure but requires robust European support.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, however, asserted that sanctions would not alter Russia's consistent stance.

रूस ने युद्ध शुरू होने के बाद से यूक्रेन पर अपनी अब तक की सबसे भीषण हवाई बमबारी की है, जिसमें कम से कम 810 ड्रोन और 13 मिसाइलें शामिल थीं। ये हमले कई घंटों तक चले और इन्होंने आवासीय तथा सरकारी इमारतों दोनों को निशाना बनाया, जिसमें एक माँ और उसके बच्चे सहित चार लोग मारे गए। इन हमलों से पहली बार कीव में यूक्रेन की मुख्य सरकारी इमारत को भी नुकसान पहुँचाया गया।

इस तीव्र हमले ने मॉस्को के खिलाफ कड़ी पश्चिमी कार्रवाई की मांगों को और बढ़ा दिया है। अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति ट्रंप ने कड़ी प्रतिबंधों की धमकी देकर जवाब दिया और कहा कि वह ""पूरी स्थिति से खुश नहीं हैं"" और ""दंड के दूसरे चरण"" में जाने के लिए तैयार हैं, हालांकि उन्होंने तत्काल कोई विवरण नहीं दिया। यह ट्रंप की पिछली धमकियों जैसा ही है जिनका कभी कोई परिणाम नहीं निकला था।

अमेरिकी ट्रेजरी सचिव स्कॉट बेसेंट ने विस्तार से बताया कि वाशिंगटन आर्थिक दबाव बढ़ाने के लिए तैयार है, लेकिन इसके लिए मजबूत यूरोपीय समर्थन की आवश्यकता है। बेसेंट ने सुझाव दिया कि यूरोपीय संघ के बढ़े हुए प्रतिबंध और रूसी तेल खरीदने वाले देशों पर लगाए जाने वाले द्वितीयक शुल्क (secondary tariffs) रूसी अर्थव्यवस्था को ""पूरी तरह से ध्वस्त"" कर सकते हैं, जिससे राष्ट्रपति पुतिन को बातचीत के लिए मजबूर होना पड़ेगा। उन्होंने इस संघर्ष को यूक्रेनी सेना के धैर्य और रूसी अर्थव्यवस्था के लचीलेपन के बीच एक ""दौड़"" बताया। हालांकि, क्रेमलिन के प्रवक्ता दिमित्री पेसकोव ने जोर देकर कहा कि प्रतिबंध रूस के सुसंगत रुख को नहीं बदलेंगे।

आज तक, वाशिंगटन का सबसे महत्वपूर्ण कदम भारतीय आयातों पर लगाया गया 50% शुल्क रहा है, जिसे पिछले महीने दिल्ली द्वारा रूसी तेल की लगातार खरीद के कारण लगाया गया था। ट्रंप ने पहले भी इस तरह के द्वितीयक प्रतिबंधों को अन्य देशों तक बढ़ाने का प्रस्ताव रखा है, लेकिन अभी तक उस पर अमल नहीं किया है।",en,[],,Trump's threat of sanctions comes after Russia's heaviest attack of the war.,[''],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

अपनी यात्रा के दौरान, ड्यूक ने कीव में द्वितीय विश्व युद्ध में यूक्रेन के इतिहास के राष्ट्रीय संग्रहालय में एक पैनल चर्चा में भाग लिया। ब्रिटिश सेना में अपने 10 साल के अनुभव का हवाला देते हुए, उन्होंने दिग्गजों को मानसिक स्वास्थ्य और पुन: एकीकरण पर सलाह दी, जिसमें खुलकर बात करने, मदद मांगने और दोस्तों तथा परिवार से मन की बात कहने के महत्व पर जोर दिया गया। उन्होंने युद्ध के दिग्गज वसील टैमुलिस, यूक्रेन की दिग्गज मामलों की मंत्री नतालिया कालमीकोवा से और यूक्रेनी अधिकारियों, जिसमें राष्ट्रपति ज़ेलेंस्की भी शामिल थे, के साथ निजी तौर पर मुलाकात की।

2014 में अपनी लॉन्च की गई इन्विक्टस गेम्स फाउंडेशन की एक टीम के साथ हैरी ने लविव में सुपरह्यूमन्स सेंटर के लिए एक धन उगाही दोपहर के भोजन में भी भाग लिया, यह वह सुविधा थी जिसका उन्होंने अप्रैल में दौरा किया था। उन्होंने पुनर्प्राप्ति में सहायता करने और ""इस युद्ध में शामिल लोगों के मानवीय पहलू को सामने लाने"" के लिए ""हर संभव"" प्रयास करने की अपनी प्रतिबद्धता दोहराई।

यह यात्रा ड्यूक की आर्कवेल फाउंडेशन द्वारा यूक्रेन और गाजा के घायल बच्चों का समर्थन करने वाली परियोजनाओं को हाल ही में $500,000 के दान के बाद हुई है। ब्रिटिश शाही परिवार के अन्य सदस्यों, जिसमें किंग चार्ल्स और प्रिंस विलियम शामिल हैं, ने भी पूर्ण पैमाने पर आक्रमण शुरू होने के बाद से सार्वजनिक रूप से यूक्रेन के लिए समर्थन व्यक्त किया है।",en,[],,"The Duke of Sussex said he wanted to do ""everything possible"" to help the recovery of military personnel injured in the war with Russia.",[''],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But will it hurt the war effort? 5 days ago Share Save Katy Watson BBC News, Kyiv Share Save BBC The law has changed to allow men under 23, like Roman, to leave Ukraine Swimming coach Roman Melnik can't get out of Kyiv quick enough. The 22-year-old is packing his bags and heading to the Czech Republic to begin a new life. There, the physical education graduate hopes to pick up swimming classes to pay his way. Only once he's got some savings together will he then work on his long-held dream of making his way across the Atlantic to Florida or Texas. ""All my family knows how much I always wanted to move to Europe and to the United States,"" he says, in his nearly bare flat in Ukraine's capital. Most of his belongings are in the suitcase already. There are just a few empty cups lying around – remnants of his farewell party at the weekend. ""They're happy of course … [but] when I visited my parents there was a lot of crying."" Until late August, Roman wasn't allowed to leave Ukraine at all. When Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022, martial law dictated that men between 18 and 60 – even those not eligible for conscription, which is currently in place for those aged between 25 and 60 – were not permitted to leave the country. President Volodymyr Zelensky has now announced that young men between the ages of 18 and 22 will no longer be barred from leaving. And those who want to return can do so freely, without the risk of being held at the border. ""If we want to keep boys in Ukraine, we really need them to finish school here first and for their parents not to take them away,"" President Zelensky explained shortly after the announcement. ""It is at this age, in their senior years, that they lose their connection with Ukraine."" Getty Images Ukraine's new school year just started - but young men are often sent abroad, rather than staying to study in Ukraine Nowhere is that loss of connection clearer than in Ukraine's colleges and universities. The buzz of the school corridor is far quieter now, with classroom sizes dwindling, especially in the final year – often families pull boys out of 12th grade and send them abroad just before they turn 18, meaning they miss high school graduation. There are fewer students enrolling at university too. The Kyiv School of Economics even has a ""Come Back Home"" initiative offering a grant that covers tuition fees and some living costs for those who left and now want to return. But Roman doesn't want to stay. And he doesn't have much time to waste before leaving either. He's turning 23 at the beginning of December. After that, the travel ban will apply. ""I was feeling a bit trapped,"" he says. ""I was ready to move that day [of the announcement], but mum convinced me to stay for a bit, so I could say goodbye to my grandparents, to my older sister, to all my friends again."" When the full-scale invasion happened, Roman says Ukrainians rushed to defend their country against Russia. But now, more than three years on, with the war showing no signs of stopping and with people he knows who have died on the front line, that feeling of patriotism among his friends is waning. ""I wouldn't choose to fight,"" he tells me. ""I know that Russia attacked my country and I would kill for my country but only [if the army] takes you and says 'You're in the army."" Getty Images Ukraine is struggling to recruit the men it needs to hold off the Russian invaders The UN estimates that as of February 2025, the war has created 6.7 million refugees. Another 3.7 million have been internally displaced. In all, Ukraine's population has dropped by 10 million people. Families fearing for their lives fled the country. While some have ventured back, especially to cities like Kyiv where Russian forces were driven out shortly after the fighting began, there's been a huge exodus. Not only that, but according to data from the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the number of Ukrainians who wanted to return home fell to 65% in 2024, down from 77% a year earlier. And the number of those who said they definitely wouldn't return rose from 5% to 11%. There's constant chatter of a manpower problem in Ukraine's military – how long will the war go on for, and will there be enough soldiers to defend the country? In April last year, Ukraine lowered the conscription age from 27 to 25. But still, it's not enough. Ukraine is under pressure, with the US reportedly urging President Zelensky to lower the conscription age to 18. In that now infamous meeting with Zelensky at the Oval Office last February, President Donald Trump accused Ukraine of ""running low on soldiers"". EPA The fractious Oval Office meeting saw Trump accuse Ukraine of lacking the manpower to fight off the Russians In a rare update last December, President Zelensky admitted that 43,000 soldiers had died since February 2022 – that number has obviously risen since. He said 370,000 soldiers had also been wounded. The manpower problem has been made worse by a low birthrate that began in the 1990s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and now exacerbated by the war. Ukraine's birth rate is the lowest in Europe. Earlier this year, the government offered a one-year contract for volunteers between the ages of 18-24 – before conscription age – complete with an attractive salary and other perks. But this decision to scrap the ban on 18-22-year-olds from travelling would appear to be encouraging people to leave. ""Few expected that a large-scale invasion would last so long,"" says political analyst Yevhen Mahda, director of the Institute of World Policy in Kyiv. Still, he's not convinced by the new rules. ""There is little logic and a lot of politics here,"" he says. Mr Mahda points to recent protests against the government dubbed the ""cardboard revolution"", so-called because of the cardboard signs carried by protesters angry about a government U-turn on an anti-corruption bill. ""I would say that this is an attempt to give young people a valve to let off steam - so that they can at least have the illusion of a quick trip abroad,"" he says. The Ukrainian State Border Guard service said recently that 13,000 people had tried to flee the country illegally since the beginning of the year – some of them repeatedly. There are even men who pay smugglers to get them over the border. Denys Vetushko, a 24-year-old from Cherkasy in central Ukraine, feels very differently. ""I am not going to hide from anyone,"" Denys says. ""When the full-scale war began, I didn't have any thoughts that I needed to leave Ukraine."" Denys, 24, has no plans to leave his country","A new Ukrainian law, set to be signed by year-end, will allow men aged 18-22 to leave the country, a controversial move amidst Ukraine's severe military manpower crisis and ongoing population exodus.

The legislation provides an opportunity for individuals like 22-year-old swimming coach Roman Melnik, who is swiftly moving to the Czech Republic to pursue education, with long-term aspirations for the U.S. Melnik, who feels ""trapped"" and whose patriotism has waned due to the war's duration and casualties, is rushing to depart before his 23rd birthday, when he would again be subject to the travel ban. His parents' farewell was tearful, highlighting the personal cost of such departures.

Ukraine faces a critical demographic challenge, with 6.7 million refugees, 3.7 million internally displaced, and a 10 million population drop. The military struggles with recruitment, having lowered the conscription age to 25 (with U.S. pressure to lower it further to 18). President Zelensky has admitted to 43,000 soldiers dead and 370,000 wounded since February 2022. This issue is exacerbated by a low birthrate predating the war.

President Zelensky defends the move, arguing it helps young men maintain a connection with Ukraine by enabling them to complete their education abroad, addressing a trend of students leaving prematurely. However, critics like political analyst Yevhen Mahda view it as a politically motivated ""valve to let off steam"" to quell public frustration, rather than a logical solution to the manpower shortage, especially given ongoing protests and widespread illegal border crossings.

While the desire to return to Ukraine among refugees is declining, and many are eager to leave, some young men, like 24-year-old Denys Vetushko, remain committed to staying and have no intention of leaving their country.","यहां अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद दिया गया है:

यूक्रेन का एक नया कानून, जिस पर साल के अंत तक हस्ताक्षर होने हैं, 18-22 वर्ष की आयु के पुरुषों को देश छोड़ने की अनुमति देगा। यूक्रेन के गंभीर सैन्य जनशक्ति संकट और लगातार हो रहे जनसंख्या पलायन के बीच यह एक विवादास्पद कदम है।

यह कानून 22 वर्षीय तैराकी कोच रोमन मेलनिक जैसे व्यक्तियों को अवसर देता है, जो शिक्षा के लिए तेजी से चेक गणराज्य जा रहे हैं और अमेरिका जाने की दीर्घकालिक इच्छा रखते हैं। मेलनिक, जो ""फंसा हुआ"" महसूस करते हैं और जिनकी देशभक्ति युद्ध की लंबी अवधि और हताहतों के कारण कम हो गई है, अपने 23वें जन्मदिन से पहले रवाना होने की जल्दी में हैं, क्योंकि उसके बाद उन पर फिर से यात्रा प्रतिबंध लागू हो जाएगा। उनके माता-पिता की विदाई अश्रुपूर्ण थी, जो ऐसे प्रस्थानों की व्यक्तिगत कीमत को दर्शाती है।

यूक्रेन एक गंभीर जनसांख्यिकीय चुनौती का सामना कर रहा है, जिसमें 67 लाख शरणार्थी, 37 लाख आंतरिक रूप से विस्थापित लोग और 1 करोड़ की आबादी में गिरावट शामिल है। सेना को भर्ती में कठिनाई हो रही है, उसने भर्ती की उम्र 25 वर्ष कर दी है (अमेरिका का दबाव है कि इसे और घटाकर 18 किया जाए)। राष्ट्रपति ज़ेलेंस्की ने स्वीकार किया है कि फरवरी 2022 से अब तक 43,000 सैनिक मारे गए हैं और 370,000 घायल हुए हैं। युद्ध से पहले से चली आ रही कम जन्म दर इस समस्या को और भी गंभीर बना देती है।

राष्ट्रपति ज़ेलेंस्की इस कदम का बचाव करते हुए तर्क देते हैं कि यह युवा पुरुषों को विदेश में अपनी शिक्षा पूरी करने में सक्षम बनाकर यूक्रेन के साथ संबंध बनाए रखने में मदद करता है, और छात्रों के समय से पहले देश छोड़ने की प्रवृत्ति को भी संबोधित करता है। हालांकि, राजनीतिक विश्लेषक येवहेन माहदा जैसे आलोचक इसे जनशक्ति की कमी का तार्किक समाधान मानने के बजाय, सार्वजनिक निराशा को शांत करने के लिए एक राजनीतिक रूप से प्रेरित ""दबाव कम करने वाला वाल्व"" मानते हैं, खासकर जारी विरोध प्रदर्शनों और व्यापक अवैध सीमा पार करने को देखते हुए।

जहां शरणार्थियों में यूक्रेन लौटने की इच्छा घट रही है और कई लोग देश छोड़ने के इच्छुक हैं, वहीं 24 वर्षीय डेनिस वेतुशको जैसे कुछ युवा पुरुष देश में रहने के लिए प्रतिबद्ध हैं और उनका अपने देश छोड़ने का कोई इरादा नहीं है।",en,[],,A new law says men under the age of 23 can now leave the country.

Foreign troops in Ukraine ""considered a danger to Russia"", Kremlin tells BBC And this came just a day after Kyiv's allies, the so-called Coalition of the Willing, had pledged a post-war ""reassurance force"" for Ukraine. Observing the scene in the hall, I found the applause quite chilling. The audience at the economic forum in Vladivostok burst into applause, with Russian officials and business leaders apparently welcoming the threat to ""destroy"" Western troops. ""If some troops appear there,"" the Russian president said, ""especially now while the fighting's going on, we proceed from the premise that these will be legitimate targets for destruction."" In the Russian Far East, Vladimir Putin delivered a warning to the West: don't even think about sending soldiers - and that includes peacekeepers - to Ukraine. Sometimes it's not what's said that makes the biggest impression. Putin said he would only meet Zelensky in Moscow - a proposal dismissed outside Russia as a non-starter The audience applauded again when the Kremlin leader suggested that he would be prepared to meet Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky - but only on home soil. ""The best place for this is the Russian capital, in Hero City Moscow,"" said Putin. Outside Russia, Putin's proposal has been dismissed as unserious, a complete non-starter. A case of political trolling. But in many ways it encapsulates the Kremlin's current position on the war in Ukraine: ""Yes, we want peace, but only on our terms. You reject our terms? No peace then."" This uncompromising stance is being fuelled by a combination of factors. First, by the Kremlin's belief that, in Ukraine, Russian forces have the initiative on the battlefield. Second, by diplomatic success. In China this week, Putin shook hands and shared smiles with a string of world leaders. The optics were all about demonstrating that Russia has powerful friends, such as China, India and North Korea. And then there's America. Last month US President Donald Trump invited Putin to Alaska for a summit meeting. Back home pro-Kremlin commentators hailed the event as evidence that Western efforts to isolate Russia over the war in Ukraine had failed. To convince the Kremlin to end the fighting Trump has previously set ultimatums and deadlines; he's threatened further sanctions if Russia won't make peace. But Trump hasn't followed through on his threats - and that's another reason for Russia's confidence. Putin publicly praises Trump's peace efforts. And yet he has rejected Trump's ceasefire proposals and shown no desire to make concessions over the war in Ukraine. So where does that leave prospects for peace? Putin said recently that he could see ""light at the end of the tunnel"". It seems to me that right now Russia on the one hand, and Ukraine and Europe (and to some extent America) on the other are in different tunnels, on different roads, with different destinations. Ukraine and Europe are focused on ending the fighting, shaping security guarantees for Kyiv and making sure that the Ukrainian army is strong enough post-war to prevent another invasion. When Putin talks about ""light at the end of the tunnel"", I believe he imagines a path that leads to a Russian victory in Ukraine, and more widely, to the construction of a new global order that benefits Russia. In terms of peace, it's hard to see where and when these two very different highways will converge.","Vladimir Putin has adopted an uncompromising stance on the conflict in Ukraine, warning that any foreign troops, even peacekeepers, would be considered ""legitimate targets"" and a danger to Russia. This stern warning came shortly after Kyiv's allies pledged a post-war ""reassurance force"" for Ukraine and was met with chilling applause from Russian officials and business leaders at an economic forum in Vladivostok, who apparently welcomed the threat to ""destroy"" Western forces.

Further encapsulating the Kremlin's ""peace on our terms"" approach, Putin proposed meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky only in ""Hero City Moscow,"" a suggestion widely dismissed outside Russia as ""unserious"" and ""political trolling."" The Kremlin's position indicates that a rejection of its terms will lead to ""no peace.""

This uncompromising stance is fueled by Moscow's perceived battlefield initiative in Ukraine and bolstered by diplomatic successes, as demonstrated by Putin's recent engagements with leaders from China, India, and North Korea. Pro-Kremlin commentators see these as proof that Western efforts to isolate Russia have failed, especially given US President Donald Trump's past unfulfilled threats and public praise for Putin's peace efforts, despite Putin's subsequent rejection of Trump's ceasefire proposals.

Consequently, prospects for peace remain dim. While Putin speaks of ""light at the end of the tunnel,"" he envisions a path leading to a Russian victory and the construction of a new global order benefiting Russia. Conversely, Ukraine and Europe are focused on ending the fighting, ensuring Kyiv's security, and strengthening the Ukrainian army post-war. These fundamentally divergent goals suggest that any convergence towards peace is currently out of sight.","यहाँ उस अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

व्लादिमीर पुतिन ने यूक्रेन संघर्ष पर एक समझौताहीन रुख अपनाया है, चेतावनी दी है कि किसी भी विदेशी सैनिक को, यहाँ तक कि शांति सेना को भी, ""वैध लक्ष्य"" माना जाएगा और रूस के लिए खतरा होगा। यह कड़ी चेतावनी कीव के सहयोगियों द्वारा यूक्रेन के लिए युद्धोपरांत ""आश्वासन बल"" का वादा करने के ठीक बाद आई, और व्लादिवोस्तोक में एक आर्थिक मंच पर रूसी अधिकारियों और व्यापारिक नेताओं से ठंडी तालियों के साथ इसका स्वागत किया गया, जिन्होंने स्पष्ट रूप से पश्चिमी सेनाओं को ""नष्ट करने"" की धमकी का स्वागत किया।

क्रेमलिन के ""हमारी शर्तों पर शांति"" के दृष्टिकोण को और स्पष्ट करते हुए, पुतिन ने यूक्रेनी राष्ट्रपति वलोडिमिर ज़ेलेंस्की से केवल ""हीरो सिटी मॉस्को"" में मिलने का प्रस्ताव रखा, एक सुझाव जिसे रूस के बाहर व्यापक रूप से ""गंभीर नहीं"" और ""राजनीतिक ट्रोलिंग"" कहकर खारिज कर दिया गया। क्रेमलिन की स्थिति दर्शाती है कि उसकी शर्तों को अस्वीकार करने से ""कोई शांति नहीं"" होगी।

यूक्रेन में मॉस्को की कथित युद्धक्षेत्र पहल और राजनयिक सफलताओं से इस समझौताहीन रुख को बल मिला है, जैसा कि चीन, भारत और उत्तर कोरिया के नेताओं के साथ पुतिन की हालिया मुलाकातों से स्पष्ट होता है। क्रेमलिन समर्थक टिप्पणीकार इसे इस बात का प्रमाण मानते हैं कि रूस को अलग-थलग करने के पश्चिमी प्रयास विफल रहे हैं, खासकर अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प की पिछली अधूरी धमकियों और पुतिन के शांति प्रयासों की सार्वजनिक प्रशंसा को देखते हुए, भले ही पुतिन ने ट्रम्प के युद्धविराम प्रस्तावों को बाद में खारिज कर दिया था।

परिणामस्वरूप, शांति की संभावनाएँ धूमिल बनी हुई हैं। जबकि पुतिन ""सुरंग के अंत में रोशनी"" की बात करते हैं, वे एक ऐसे मार्ग की कल्पना करते हैं जो रूसी जीत और रूस को लाभ पहुँचाने वाली एक नई वैश्विक व्यवस्था के निर्माण की ओर ले जाता है। इसके विपरीत, यूक्रेन और यूरोप लड़ाई समाप्त करने, कीव की सुरक्षा सुनिश्चित करने और युद्धोपरांत यूक्रेनी सेना को मजबूत करने पर ध्यान केंद्रित कर रहे हैं। ये मौलिक रूप से भिन्न लक्ष्य बताते हैं कि शांति की दिशा में कोई भी अभिसरण (मिलन) वर्तमान में दूर की कौड़ी है।",en,[],,"Moscow's diplomatic success in China, and Trump's lack of action, have emboldened Putin, reports Steve Rosenberg.",[''],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Locations from Geneva and Vienna to Budapest or Istanbul have all been mooted as possible venues. Putin and Zelensky have not been in the same room since 2019, three years before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The US president said he had ""begun arrangements"" for the summit, indicating he believed Putin had agreed to it over the phone on Monday. This may have been an optimistic reading of the conversation. Almost at once, the Kremlin shared its own, more vague version of the exchange. Trump and Putin had discussed ""the possibility of raising the level of representatives"" - said aide Yuri Ushakov – and that could simply mean that ministers, instead of envoys, may take part in the talks. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that a meeting could happen ""within the next two weeks"". But, he cautioned, ""we don't know whether the Russian president will have the courage to attend such a summit"" and he pushed for Putin to be ""persuaded"". Trump mentioned a ""rough"" situation for Russia, should Putin not co-operate in the peace process, but declined to be more specific. Now, as the diplomatic whirlwind dies down, the likelihood of a meeting between Putin and Zelensky seems to be further diminishing. On the surface, Moscow appears to be open to taking part in bilateral talks between the two presidents. In reality, though, the preconditions it is attaching to a meeting will almost certainly prove unacceptable to the Ukrainian side. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said this week that Putin was ready to meet Zelensky provided that all ""issues"" that required consideration ""at the highest level"" were worked out. This vague yet uncompromising language has been used by the Kremlin in the past to resist Ukrainian proposals for a bilateral meeting. Last week Trump envoy Steve Witkoff said that Russia had accepted security guarantees for Ukraine, calling it ""a very significant step"". But it now appears that the guarantees in question would be modelled on those first floated by Moscow and rejected by Kyiv in 2022, which would see Russia join a group of countries wielding a power of veto over military intervention in defence of Ukraine. Getty Images Steve Witkoff said Russia had accepted security guarantees for Ukraine - but these now appear to have significant strings attached That proposal would also see a ban on Western troops being stationed in Ukraine, effectively leaving it defenceless in the event of a fresh Russian invasion. Lavrov said on Thursday that any other security framework would be ""an absolutely futile undertaking"". Zelensky, meanwhile, has said any meeting with Putin would need to come after Kyiv's allies agreed on security guarantees – which would undoubtedly involve the support of Western forces and exclude Russia, making it the kind that Moscow would never accept. As things stand, neither Russia nor Ukraine seem ready to budge from their long-held positions - and each is accusing the other of undermining efforts to reach a peace deal.","Prospects for a direct summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, despite initial optimism, are now significantly diminishing. The two leaders, who have never met and haven't been in the same room since 2019, were the subject of an ambitious push for a bilateral meeting.

Early discussions, largely spurred by former US President Donald Trump who expressed confidence such a meeting could happen and even claimed Putin's agreement, now appear to have stalled. While various locations from Geneva and Vienna to Budapest, Istanbul, Germany, and France were mooted, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz suggested a meeting was possible, concerns about Putin's willingness and commitment quickly emerged. Trump had also warned of a ""rough"" situation for Russia if Putin did not cooperate.

The primary obstacle lies in deeply entrenched and irreconcilable preconditions from both sides, particularly regarding Ukraine's security. Moscow, while ostensibly open to talks and with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stating Putin was ready, insists on security guarantees that echo its 2022 proposals, which Kyiv previously rejected. These include Russia joining a group with veto power over military intervention in Ukraine and a ban on Western troops, effectively leaving Ukraine vulnerable to future aggression. Lavrov has deemed any other security framework ""futile.""

Conversely, President Zelensky maintains that any meeting with Putin must follow an agreement on robust security guarantees from Kyiv's Western allies, explicitly involving Western forces and excluding Russia. With neither side willing to budge from their long-held positions and each accusing the other of undermining peace efforts, the likelihood of a high-level summit appears increasingly remote.","**रूसी राष्ट्रपति व्लादिमीर पुतिन और यूक्रेनी राष्ट्रपति वलोडिमिर ज़ेलेंस्की के बीच सीधी शिखर वार्ता की संभावनाएँ, शुरुआती आशावाद के बावजूद, अब काफी कम हो रही हैं। दोनों नेता, जो कभी नहीं मिले और 2019 के बाद से एक ही कमरे में नहीं रहे हैं, उनके लिए एक महत्वाकांक्षी द्विपक्षीय बैठक की कोशिश की गई थी।**

**शुरुआती चर्चाएँ, जिन्हें पूर्व अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप ने मुख्य रूप से बढ़ावा दिया था – जिन्होंने ऐसी बैठक होने का विश्वास व्यक्त किया था और यहाँ तक कि पुतिन की सहमति का दावा भी किया था – अब रुक गई लगती हैं। जबकि जिनेवा और वियना से लेकर बुडापेस्ट, इस्तांबुल, जर्मनी और फ्रांस तक विभिन्न स्थानों को प्रस्तावित किया गया था, और जर्मन चांसलर फ्रेडरिक मेर्ज़ ने बैठक संभव होने का सुझाव भी दिया था, लेकिन पुतिन की इच्छा और प्रतिबद्धता को लेकर चिंताएँ जल्दी ही सामने आ गईं। ट्रंप ने यह भी चेतावनी दी थी कि यदि पुतिन सहयोग नहीं करते हैं तो रूस के लिए एक 'कठिन' स्थिति पैदा हो जाएगी।**

**मुख्य बाधा दोनों पक्षों की गहराई से निहित और असंगत पूर्व-शर्तों में निहित है, विशेष रूप से यूक्रेन की सुरक्षा के संबंध में। मॉस्को, दिखावटी तौर पर बातचीत के लिए खुला होने और रूसी विदेश मंत्री सर्गेई लावरोव के यह कहने के बावजूद कि पुतिन तैयार थे, उन सुरक्षा गारंटियों पर जोर देता है जो उसके 2022 के प्रस्तावों की प्रतिध्वनि करती हैं, और जिन्हें कीव ने पहले ही खारिज कर दिया था। इनमें यूक्रेन में सैन्य हस्तक्षेप पर रूस का वीटो शक्ति वाले समूह में शामिल होना और पश्चिमी सैनिकों पर प्रतिबंध शामिल है, जो प्रभावी रूप से यूक्रेन को भविष्य की आक्रामकता के प्रति संवेदनशील छोड़ देगा। लावरोव ने किसी भी अन्य सुरक्षा ढाँचे को 'व्यर्थ' बताया है।**

**इसके विपरीत, राष्ट्रपति ज़ेलेंस्की का कहना है कि पुतिन के साथ कोई भी बैठक कीव के पश्चिमी सहयोगियों से मजबूत सुरक्षा गारंटियों पर एक समझौते के बाद होनी चाहिए, जिसमें स्पष्ट रूप से पश्चिमी सेनाएँ शामिल हों और रूस को बाहर रखा जाए। चूंकि कोई भी पक्ष अपनी लंबे समय से चली आ रही स्थिति से झुकने को तैयार नहीं है और एक-दूसरे पर शांति प्रयासों को कमजोर करने का आरोप लगा रहा है, इसलिए उच्च-स्तरीय शिखर वार्ता की संभावना तेजी से दूर होती जा रही है।**",en,[],,"Geneva, Istanbul and Budapest have been put forward as potential locations - but bilateral talks still remain a long way off.",[''],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Russia's drone incursion into Poland is a test for Nato Poland closest to open conflict since World War Two, warns PM ""No objects on Polish territory were planned to be targeted,"" Moscow said. Russia has pushed back against accusations that the incursion was deliberate – though it also stopped short of denying its drones had trespassed sovereign Polish airspace. Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Polish airspace was violated 19 times and at least three drones were shot down by Warsaw's jets, aided by Dutch F-35s and an Italian early warning aircraft. Wednesday morning's incursion of Russian drones into Polish airspace led to jets being scrambled, an emergency government meeting being called - and concerns that Europe and Nato's resolve against Moscow may not be up to the test. ""There is no evidence whatsoever that this amount of drones flew over this route over... Polish territory by accident,"" Germany's Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said, while his Italian counterpart Guido Crosetto called the overnight events in Poland a ""deliberate attack"" with the double aim of ""provoking and testing"". But European officials have forcefully batted off suggestions the act may have been unintentional. One of the drones appeared to damage a home in the Wyryki municipality in eastern Poland Although Poland has experienced several violations of its airspace since neighbouring Ukraine was attacked by Russia in February 2022, this latest incursion - sizeable, and deep into Polish territory - sparked real nervousness in Warsaw. Tusk warned that Poland was at its closest to open conflict since World War Two. He also requested invoking Article 4 of the Nato treaty, which allows member countries to start a discussion with allies about threats to their security. Some experts and analysts are divided over Russia's motivations. To some, the drones – some of which flew in the direction of Rzeszow airport, a major logistical hub for defence supplies and humanitarian aid bound for Ukraine – may have had reconnaissance purposes, with poor guidance leading to accidental airspace trespass. ""There is an issue with proving intention,"" said Dr Marina Miron, a defence researcher at Kings College London. She believes GPS spoofing may have been responsible for the drones crossing into Polish airspace and cautioned against drawing conclusions based on snippets of information. ""It can lead [the incident] to appear as something it is not,"" Dr Miron added. Many others believe, however, the relatively high number of drones flown into Polish airspace clearly demonstrates that the attack was deliberate. ""Previous incursions were single or very small numbers that were more easily explained by guidance system malfunctions,"" Justin Bronk of the defence think tank Rusi told the BBC. Justin Crump, CEO of the risk and intelligence company Sibylline, agreed. He said the drones in question appear to be Russian-made cheap, long-range drone Gerberas which can be used as decoys to distract defences as part of Russia's increasing ""grey zone actions against Nato"". The lack of warheads on the Gerberas drones employed on Wednesday make them appear less threatening and allow Russia to play down the action, Mr Crump added. Poland will now need to review the incident and share the findings with its allies. Whether deliberate or not, the unprecedented incident will provide valuable information to Moscow on the type of response it can expect from the West should it ever decide to launch an attack on Nato countries, as many European leaders have said they expect it to do in the near future. ""It is a test for Europe and for Nato regardless of Russia's intent"", said Keir Giles, a senior fellow in the Russia and Eurasia program at Chatham House. ""Russia will learn from European resolve and specifically Poland's capacity to withstand attacks of this kind."" Expressions of condemnation rather than a robust response will be just as encouraging to Russia if it was an accident as if it were a deliberate provocation, Mr Giles added. He said a sky shield to protect airspace over Ukraine would prove to Russia the West is serious about ensuring air threats are intercepted. But such a plan - which would involve European countries deploying fighter jets and pilots - has led to fears of accidental confrontation with the Russians and has not come to pass despite first being floated since 2023. The US's reaction to the incident in Poland will also be awaited – and closely followed. Some US lawmakers in both the Democrat and Republican camps condemned the attack soon after it occurred. However, as of Wednesday evening US President Donald Trump had only acknowledged the events in Poland through a post on social media. ""What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Here we go!"", he wrote without elaborating further. The cryptic post was in line with his ambiguous relationship with Russia and its President Vladimir Putin. Over the course of the last month Trump both rolled out the red carpet for the Russian president and threatened sanctions against Moscow if it failed to reach peace with Kyiv. These threats have not yet materialised, and even warnings of unspecified ""consequences"" for Russia's aggression in Ukraine appear to have fallen by the wayside. As its leaders scramble to put together a show of unity and strength, Europe – which has been concerned about the American commitment to the security of the continent since the start of Trump's second term – will be watching the US's next move just as closely as Russia. ""A sign of weakness and failure to impose costs and consequences will confirm for Moscow that they can continue to escalate without fear of the outcome,"" Mr Giles said. Additional reporting by Matt Murphy and Paul Brown","Russian drones breached Polish airspace on Wednesday morning, triggering an immediate scramble of jets, an emergency government meeting, and a stark warning from Prime Minister Donald Tusk that Poland faces its closest threat of open conflict since World War Two. Tusk reported 19 violations and stated that Polish forces shot down at least three drones, requesting the invocation of Article 4 of the NATO treaty for allied discussions on security threats.

While Russia denied deliberate intent, it did not deny the airspace trespass. However, European officials, including Germany's Defence Minister Boris Pistorius and Italy's Guido Crosetto, unequivocally labeled the event a ""deliberate attack,"" dismissing any claims of accident given the scale of the incursion. The incident saw drones flying towards the vital Rzeszow airport, a logistical hub for aid to Ukraine, with one drone reportedly damaging a home in eastern Poland.

Experts remain divided on Russia's motivations. Some, noting the relatively high number of drones — identified as cheap, long-range Gerberas potentially used as decoys without warheads — believe it was a deliberate provocation to test Western defenses. Others suggest it could have been accidental, caused by poor guidance or GPS spoofing, urging caution against drawing quick conclusions.

Regardless of intent, the incident is widely viewed as a critical test for Europe and NATO's unity and resolve against Moscow. Analysts like Keir Giles of Chatham House warned that a weak response or failure to impose consequences would embolden Russia to escalate further. He suggested a ""sky shield"" over Ukraine as a strong demonstration of the West's commitment to intercepting air threats.

Global attention now also focuses on the United States' reaction. US lawmakers from both parties condemned the incursion, but President Donald Trump's cryptic social media post, in line with his ambiguous stance on Russia, has heightened European concerns about America's commitment to continental security. European leaders are closely watching Washington's next move, understanding that any perceived weakness could confirm for Moscow that it can continue to escalate without fear of significant repercussions.","यहाँ अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

हालांकि, रूस ने जानबूझकर ऐसा करने के इरादे से इनकार किया, लेकिन उसने हवाई क्षेत्र के अतिक्रमण से इनकार नहीं किया। वहीं, यूरोपीय अधिकारियों, जिनमें जर्मनी के रक्षा मंत्री बोरिस पिस्टोरियस और इटली के गुइडो क्रोसेटो शामिल हैं, ने घुसपैठ के पैमाने को देखते हुए दुर्घटना के किसी भी दावे को खारिज करते हुए, इस घटना को स्पष्ट रूप से ""जानबूझकर किया गया हमला"" करार दिया। इस घटना में ड्रोन महत्वपूर्ण रेज़्ज़ो (Rzeszow) हवाई अड्डे की ओर उड़ते हुए देखे गए, जो यूक्रेन को सहायता के लिए एक रसद केंद्र है। कथित तौर पर एक ड्रोन ने पूर्वी पोलैंड में एक घर को भी नुकसान पहुंचाया।

रूस के इरादों को लेकर विशेषज्ञ बंटे हुए हैं। कुछ विशेषज्ञ, बड़ी संख्या में सस्ते, लंबी दूरी के गेरबेरा (Gerberas) ड्रोन (जिन्हें संभवतः बिना वारहेड के धोखे के रूप में इस्तेमाल किया गया होगा) की उपस्थिति को देखते हुए, इसे पश्चिमी देशों की सुरक्षा तैयारियों का परीक्षण करने के लिए एक जानबूझकर की गई उकसावे की कार्रवाई मानते हैं। अन्य इसे खराब मार्गदर्शन या जीपीएस (GPS) स्पूफिंग के कारण हुई एक आकस्मिक घटना मानते हैं और त्वरित निष्कर्ष निकालने के खिलाफ सावधानी बरतने का आग्रह करते हैं।

इरादा कुछ भी हो, इस घटना को व्यापक रूप से यूरोप और नाटो (NATO) की मास्को के खिलाफ एकता और संकल्प के लिए एक महत्वपूर्ण परीक्षा के रूप में देखा जा रहा है। चैथम हाउस के कीर जाइल्स (Keir Giles) जैसे विश्लेषकों ने चेतावनी दी कि एक कमजोर प्रतिक्रिया या परिणाम लागू करने में विफलता रूस को और अधिक बढ़ने के लिए प्रोत्साहित करेगी। उन्होंने यूक्रेन के ऊपर एक ""स्काई शील्ड"" (sky shield) का सुझाव दिया, जो हवाई खतरों को रोकने के लिए पश्चिमी देशों की प्रतिबद्धता का एक मजबूत प्रदर्शन होगा।

वैश्विक ध्यान अब संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका की प्रतिक्रिया पर भी केंद्रित है। दोनों दलों के अमेरिकी सांसदों ने घुसपैठ की निंदा की, लेकिन राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप (Donald Trump) की रहस्यमय सोशल मीडिया पोस्ट, जो रूस पर उनके अस्पष्ट रुख के अनुरूप है, ने महाद्वीपीय सुरक्षा के प्रति अमेरिका की प्रतिबद्धता के बारे में यूरोपीय चिंताओं को बढ़ा दिया है। यूरोपीय नेता वाशिंगटन (Washington) के अगले कदम पर बारीकी से नज़र रख रहे हैं, यह समझते हुए कि कोई भी कमजोरी मास्को को यह पुष्टि कर सकती है कि वह बिना किसी बड़े परिणाम के डर के साथ अपनी गतिविधियों को और बढ़ा सकता है।",en,[],,"Whether the drone incursion was deliberate or accidental, Moscow will be watching Nato's response to it closely.",[''],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But not everything is what it seems in the Russia-Ukraine war. That video was followed by Ukrainian footage showing a laughing soldier pointing at the burning wreckage and exclaiming: ""They've hit my wooden tank!"" The tank in question appears to be a plywood decoy used by the Ukrainian forces to deceive the Russians. It is one of many thousands of full-scale models of military equipment used by both Ukraine and Russia to trick the enemy into wasting valuable ammunition, time and effort. Almost anything seen on the frontline - from small radars and grenade launchers to jeeps, trucks, tanks and actual soldiers - may be fake. These imitations can come in flat-packs, be inflatable, 2D or create a radar illusion of a tank by reflecting radio waves in a special way. In the case of some weapon types deployed in Ukraine, at least half of them are actually decoy imitations. Flat-pack artillery Among the most popular decoys used by the Ukrainian army are models of the British-made M777 howitzers. Western allies are understood to have supplied Kyiv with more than 150 of these highly manoeuvrable and accurate artillery pieces, nicknamed ""Three Axes"" by Ukrainian soldiers. As with many other types of equipment used by the Ukrainian army, volunteers play an important role in supplying decoy mock-ups. Ruslan Klimenko says his volunteer group Na Chasi alone has made and supplied to Ukrainian forces about 160 models of M777s. What makes them particularly popular is the fact that they take three minutes, two people and no tools to assemble on the front line, Mr Klimenko says. ""No matter how many are delivered, all will be put to good use,"" he tells the BBC. Pavlo Narozhny from another group of volunteers, called Reaktyvna Poshta, says that at any given time 10-15 M777 decoys are in production. Reaktyvna Poshta's decoys are made of plywood, come in flat packs and cost about $500 - $600. Apate Imitation M777 howitzers are particularly popular with Ukrainian troops Russia often targets them with Lancet kamikaze drones costing about $35,000. ""You do the math"", Mr Narozhny says. One of his M777 decoys, nicknamed Tolya, has spent more than a year on the frontline, surviving hits with at least 14 Lancets, he claims. Troops ""keep putting it back together with some sticky tape and screws, and back off to the frontline it goes"", Mr Narozhny says. Wheel ruts and toilets Much depends on how decoys are deployed. To successfully draw enemy fire, it helps to faithfully recreate a real position complete with wheel ruts, ammunition crates and toilets. When properly done, this can deceive not just the enemy, but visiting officers too. ""We had an instance in one brigade where a visiting commander was fooled by a decoy: He asked: 'Who gave the order to deploy artillery? Where did the M777s come from?'"" says an officer from Ukraine's 33rd Detached Mechanised Brigade, who uses the callsign Charisma. Rosenberg: What's behind Putin's uncompromising stance on Ukraine? It's 4,000 miles from Ukraine - but even this Asian city is part of Russia's war Putin rejects Western security in Ukraine, warning troops would be target According to him, another tactic is to quickly remove real cannons such as mortars after use and replace them with decoys. ""They're ideal for deceiving the enemy and making them waste expensive resources on nothing. They work, we need more of them,"" he says. Back and Alive Inflatable decoys - such as this Ukrainian imitation of the Acacia howitzer - are light, quick and simple to install, but can be easily destroyed Russia's arsenal of decoys is also rich and varied. About half of the drones involved in any of Russia's recent aerial attacks are actually cheap imitations, the Ukrainian military says. ""It's fifty-fifty these days. Fifty per cent are real Shahed drones, and fifty per cent are imitation drones. Their job is to overload our air defences and ideally get us to use a missile against a drone that costs peanuts,"" says Ukrainian air force spokesman Yuri Ihnat. ""Sometimes it's a plywood thing that looks as though it was knocked together by some schoolchildren."" While up in the air, however, it looks the same as a lethal Shahed drone to Ukrainian radars, Col Ihnat says. One Russian firm, Rusbal, produces imitations that include 2D decoys to mislead intelligence gathering from the air or space, decoys that mimic the heat given out by engines or radio traffic coming from soldiers' walkie-talkies, and reflectors that fool the enemy's radars. Actual soldiers can be imitated too. Volunteers from the Kremlin-backed People's Front movement in Novosibirsk have made dummies wearing military uniforms. To imitate human heat and thus deceive Ukrainian thermal imaging cameras, their trunks are wrapped with heating wire underneath the jacket. People's Front Novosibirsk This Russian-made dummy imitates heat given out by a human body","Both Ukrainian and Russian forces are extensively employing military decoys, including inflatable tanks, flat-pack guns, and dummy soldiers, to deceive the enemy, waste valuable resources, and protect genuine equipment.

Ukraine's use of plywood M777 howitzer decoys, often produced by volunteer groups for $500-600 and assembled quickly, is highlighted as particularly effective. These imitations successfully draw fire from expensive Russian Lancet kamikaze drones, which cost around $35,000, demonstrating significant cost-efficiency. One such decoy, nicknamed 'Tolya,' is claimed to have survived over a year on the frontline, enduring hits from at least 14 Lancets and being repeatedly repaired. Proper deployment, involving meticulous recreation of real positions with details like wheel ruts and ammunition crates, is crucial and can even fool visiting commanders.

Russia, too, utilizes a varied array of decoys. Up to half of its recent aerial attack drones are cheap imitations designed to overload Ukrainian air defenses and provoke the use of costly missiles against inexpensive targets. Additionally, Russian firms create sophisticated decoys that mimic heat signatures, radio traffic, and radar reflections, alongside dummy soldiers equipped with heating wire to simulate human body heat for thermal imaging deception. This widespread ""decoy war"" underscores the strategic importance of deception in modern conflict.","यूक्रेनी और रूसी दोनों सेनाएँ दुश्मन को धोखा देने, मूल्यवान संसाधनों को बर्बाद करने और असली उपकरणों की रक्षा के लिए बड़े पैमाने पर नकली सैन्य उपकरण (decoys) का उपयोग कर रही हैं, जिनमें हवा भरने वाले टैंक, फ्लैट-पैक बंदूकें और नकली सैनिक शामिल हैं।

यूक्रेन द्वारा प्लाईवुड से बने M777 हॉवित्जर के छद्म उपकरणों का उपयोग, जो अक्सर स्वयंसेवी समूहों द्वारा $500-600 में बनाए जाते हैं और जल्दी से जोड़े जा सकते हैं, को विशेष रूप से प्रभावी बताया गया है। ये नकली उपकरण सफलतापूर्वक महंगे रूसी लांसेट कामिकेज़ ड्रोनों (जिनकी कीमत लगभग $35,000 है) की आग को अपनी ओर आकर्षित करते हैं, जिससे महत्वपूर्ण लागत-दक्षता प्रदर्शित होती है। ऐसे ही एक छद्म उपकरण, जिसका उपनाम 'टोल्या' है, के बारे में दावा किया गया है कि वह एक साल से अधिक समय तक मोर्चे पर टिका रहा है, उसने कम से कम 14 लांसेट ड्रोनों के हमलों का सामना किया है और उसकी बार-बार मरम्मत की जाती रही है। सही तैनाती, जिसमें पहियों के निशान और गोला-बारूद के बक्से जैसे विवरणों के साथ वास्तविक स्थानों का सावधानीपूर्वक पुनर्निर्माण शामिल है, महत्वपूर्ण है और यहां तक कि दौरा करने वाले कमांडरों को भी धोखा दे सकता है।

रूस भी विभिन्न प्रकार के छद्म उपकरणों का उपयोग करता है। उसके हालिया हवाई हमला करने वाले ड्रोनों में से आधे तक सस्ते नकली होते हैं, जिन्हें यूक्रेनी हवाई सुरक्षा को ओवरलोड करने और सस्ते लक्ष्यों के खिलाफ महंगी मिसाइलों के उपयोग को उकसाने के लिए डिज़ाइन किया गया है। इसके अतिरिक्त, रूसी कंपनियाँ परिष्कृत नकली उपकरण बनाती हैं जो गर्मी के निशान (heat signatures), रेडियो संचार और रडार प्रतिबिंबों की नकल करते हैं। वे ऐसे नकली सैनिक भी बनाते हैं जिनमें हीटिंग तार लगे होते हैं ताकि थर्मल इमेजिंग द्वारा धोखा देने के लिए मानव शरीर की गर्मी का अनुकरण किया जा सके। यह व्यापक ""छलावा युद्ध"" आधुनिक संघर्ष में धोखे के रणनीतिक महत्व को रेखांकित करता है।",en,[],,Both Russia and Ukraine are using blow up dolls and plastic decoys as tricks on the battlefield.,[''],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The players have removed their prosthetic legs and are sitting in specially designed sleds. They're using their hockey sticks to propel themselves around the rink. Dmitry hopes that one day he'll be a Paralympic ice hockey champion. Making that happen won't be easy. Russian teams were banned from the last Paralympic Games over the war in Ukraine. And like all his teammates, Dmitry was on the front line. ""A mine came flying towards me,"" recalls Dmitry, who was mobilised to fight in Ukraine. ""I fell to the ground and could feel my leg burning. I looked down and everything was torn apart. I put on a tourniquet myself and told the guys to drag me out of there. ""My wife's a surgeon. So, I sent her a picture of my leg and she replied: 'They'll probably saw it off.' 'OK,' I said. Whether I have one leg, or two legs. Whatever."" The port city of Vladivostok is more than 4,000 miles from Ukraine and from Russia's capital. This is Asia. The border with North Korea is 80 miles from Vladivostok. China is just 35 miles away. Yet the consequences of a distant war in Europe are more than visible. At a cemetery on a hill overlooking Vladivostok there are lines of fresh graves: Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine. In addition to Orthodox Christian crosses, military banners and Russian tricolours mark each plot. In another section of the cemetery stands a memorial ""to the heroes of the Special Military Operation"", the official label the Kremlin continues to employ for Russia's war on Ukraine. Here there are more graves of Russian servicemen and the statue of an armed Russian soldier. ""Soldiers live forever,"" reads the inscription. On the orders of President Putin, Russian troops poured across the border with Ukraine in February 2022. The full-scale invasion of Russia's neighbour was widely seen as the Kremlin's attempt to force Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit. More than three and a half years later the war rages on. Even in Vladivostok, 4,000 miles from Ukraine, there are signs of Russia's ongoing invasion On air I'm often asked: what do the Russian people think about the war in Ukraine, about confrontation with the West, and about President Putin? ""What do Russians think?"" is a difficult question to answer. After all, Russia is so big and varied. The largest country in the world spans two continents and 11 time zones. Some parts of Russia, such as Kursk and Belgorod, border Ukraine. Other Russian regions, like Primorsky Krai where I am now are a long way from the fighting. Vladivostok is its administrative centre. This is the furthest I've travelled inside Russia since the start of the war. It's a chance to gauge the mood in a very different part of the country. ""Of course we're worried,"" Svetlana tells me in a Vladivostok park when I ask her about Ukraine. ""This has been going on for years now and we want it to end as soon as possible. We had hoped the Alaska summit [of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin] would change something. It hasn't. ""People are people. No matter whether they're British or American, Japanese or Ukrainian. I don't know where all the hatred comes from."" I get chatting to Ilya, who claims that war in Ukraine hasn't fundamentally changed his life in Russia. ""You can still earn a living and get by here,"" Ilya says. ""The standard of living isn't rising, but it's not falling, either. Still, we hope that relations with other countries will improve and that we'll be re-integrated into the global space."" Svetlana says people wanted Putin's meeting with Donald Trump in Alaska to change something In the centre of Vladivostok I stop to listen to a band busking on a pedestrian street. I'm not alone. A large crowd has gathered to enjoy the improvised rock concert. Between songs I talk to the lead singer, a young local musician who calls himself Johnny London. ""Do people talk much about what's happening in Ukraine?"" I enquire. ""People of my age, we don't usually discuss that stuff. Not very often. I would go as far as to say we never talk about that."" ""Why?"" I ask. ""We can do nothing about that. It's out of our hands, out of our reach. Hopefully in a couple of years it will get back to normal."" ""And what is normal?"" ""No war, I guess. That would be nice."" Local musician Johnny London says young people like him never talk about Russia's war on Ukraine When I finish talking to Johnny London, a pensioner called Viktor walks up. He's recognised me. He saw me on TV last year at a press conference with Vladimir Putin. ""You asked Putin a question, didn't you?"" Viktor says. ""You're with the BBC."" Viktor's a big fan. Not of the BBC, but of President Putin. He criticises my ""provocative question"" to the Kremlin leader on the war in Ukraine, he defends Russia's political system and takes aim at the Biden administration over the 2016 US presidential election. ""With the help of mail-in ballots Biden practically stole the election from Trump,"" Viktor says. ""That's what Trump says,"" I point out. ""Not only. Putin says it too,"" retorts Viktor. ""Putin saying it doesn't make it fact,"" I suggest. ""True,"" concedes Viktor. ""But that's what our people think."" Viktor also thinks that the West is losing power and influence. ""Look what's happening,"" says Viktor. ""This week in China the leaders of India, China and Russia got together, and with many other countries too. But there was no Trump, no Britain, no Germany, no France. India and China alone are three billion people."" On his way back from China Vladimir Putin is stopping off in Vladivostok. Should I get the opportunity to ask the president another question, Viktor suggests it should be about the ""new world order"". The city has been preparing for the Kremlin leader's visit and participation in the Eastern Economic Forum. By the side of the road that leads to the venue, street artist Filipp Dulmachenko has used 1,800 cans of aerosol paint to create a most unusual image. The gigantic mural depicts Vladimir Putin in military fatigues hugging a Siberian tiger. Filipp Dulmachenko used to get in trouble for his art - but this mural was officially approved","Even 4,000 miles from the front lines, Russia's war in Ukraine casts a long shadow over the Asian city of Vladivostok. The local Para ice hockey team, Soyuz, is comprised of players like Dmitry who lost limbs fighting in Ukraine. Dmitry, who vividly recounts his leg amputation after a mine explosion, dreams of becoming a Paralympic champion despite Russia's ban from international competitions.

The human cost of the conflict is visibly present in Vladivostok's cemetery, where fresh graves of soldiers killed in Ukraine are marked by military banners and a memorial dedicated to the ""heroes of the Special Military Operation,"" the Kremlin's term for the war that began in February 2022.

Public sentiment in this distant city is diverse. Svetlana voices worry and a desire for the war's swift end, regretting a lack of change from past diplomatic efforts. Ilya notes his life remains largely unchanged but expresses hope for improved international relations. Young musician Johnny London reveals his generation largely avoids discussing the war, feeling powerless and yearning for a return to ""no war"" normality. Conversely, pensioner Viktor, a staunch Putin supporter, criticizes ""provocative questions"" about the war, echoes claims of a ""stolen"" US election, and champions the idea of a ""new world order"" where Western influence wanes.

President Putin's upcoming visit to Vladivostok for the Eastern Economic Forum is underscored by an officially approved mural depicting him in military fatigues embracing a Siberian tiger, reflecting the official narrative surrounding the conflict.","यहाँ अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद दिया गया है:

""[Kirk] introduced me to some of the people who would run my [Senate] campaign and also to Donald Trump Jr,"" the vice-president wrote in a powerful tribute he penned hours after Kirk's death. ""Don took a call from me because Charlie asked him."" Three years after that winning Senate run, when the elder Donald Trump was pondering his choice of presidential running mate, Kirk argued the case for Vance ""in public and private"", Vance wrote. 'We have him' - how suspect was caught By then, Kirk was already a fixture in Trump's orbit, courting donors and discussing strategies at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and hosting Turning Point USA summits hosted by local Republicans. He never ran for office or held an official government position, but Kirk rose from being an unknown activist from the suburbs of Chicago to standard bearer of Donald Trump's Maga movement. Kirk was President Trump's bridge to young Republicans, and Trump credited him and his organisation with his victory in 2024. He was also a close personal friend of the Trump family, a key White House adviser, a hero to many young Republicans and a foil for the party's opponents. Getty Images A meteoric rise to MAGA star Born in a suburb of Chicago in 1993, Kirk got started early in conservative politics, first penning an essay for right-wing Breitbart News at the age of 18, accusing schools of spreading ""propaganda"" and ""indoctrination"". He caught the eye of Bill Montgomery, a retired businessman and Tea Party activist more than 50 years his senior, who took Kirk under his wing. In 2012 – around the midpoint of Barack Obama's presidency – the pair founded Turning Point USA (TPUSA), a group which focused on conservative activism on college campuses, spreading rapidly along with Kirk's social media following. The group tapped into online media and spread a slickly packaged style of conservatism to young people. It won him a speaking place, aged 22, at the 2016 Republican National Convention. At the time, Kirk - who had worked with more conventional Republican candidates in the past - admitted to a Wired magazine that he ""was not the world's biggest Donald Trump fan"". But from that moment on he quickly became one of Trump's biggest backers, steadfastly tracking the Maga agenda and disagreeing only on rare occasions. Suspect in custody - what we know so far Who is Tyler Robinson? Following Kirk's death, Jared Kushner - the president's son in-law - wrote on X that he ""played a significant role in helping President Trump's 2016 campaign, building and fostering the Maga movement"", adding that he told established political organisations that ""he comes with big ideas, is easy to work with and always overdelivers."" Lawrence Muir, a former official in Trump's first administration, said that Kirk's influence was key early on in Trump's first term, and that TPUSA ""was the main recruitment vehicle for younger people."" But perhaps his more far-reaching impact, Mr Muir said, was in giving other conservatives an understanding of social media and how to reach young people. ""What [Kirk] really did was give a launching pad to those who weren't as interested in becoming bureaucratic functionaries, but were in going out and building winning coalitions,"" he said. Hard-right Trump loyalist Kirk's political views drifted rightward over time. He was against gay marriage and abortion, argued for Christian nationalism and was highly critical of Islam, and famously said that gun deaths were ""worth it"" for the right to own firearms. He was also an opponent of diversity programmes and spread falsehoods about topics such as Covid vaccines and voting fraud. Above all, he was loyal to Trump. At the end of Trump's first term, with the president pushing false allegations of election fraud, Kirk bragged about sending 80 buses of supporters to Washington just in time for the rally which devolved into the Jan 6 riot at the US Capitol. Kirk was hauled in front of a Congressional committee investigating the riot and declined to say much of anything, instead invoking his constitutional right not to incriminate himself. But by July 2024 he had tempered his views, telling the BBC that he believed it existed but only ""on the edges"". Instead, he said and his group were laser focused - like the Trump campaign - on maximising early voting methods that they had previously shunned as illegitimate and ripe for fraud. Credit from Trump Kirk poured millions of TPUSA dollars and thousands of volunteers into get-out-the-vote efforts in swing states during last year's election, and his strategy appears to have worked. The organisation's ""ground game"" was crucial, analysts say, helping make up for the formal Trump campaign's struggles reaching infrequent voters, or those untouched by traditional outreach. Although Democrat Kamala Harris won the youth vote overall, it was by a far smaller margin than that of Joe Biden's 2020 victory. Obituary: Conservative influencer who rallied a youth movement Conservative influencer who rallied a youth movement Young fans and critics debate Kirk's political legacy Trump himself gave Kirk credit at TPUSA's annual AmericaFest conference in December, just a few weeks after his election victory. ""I want to express my tremendous gratitude to Charlie Kirk. He's really an amazing guy, amazing guy and his whole staff for their relentless efforts to achieve this very historic victory,"" Trump said. The gathering was triumphant, bombastic and slickly produced, with huge video screens - a demonstration of TPUSA's deep pockets. The group has now spread to 3,500 high schools and colleges and brought in more than $85m (£62m) last year, according to investigative journalism outlet ProPublica. It also showed off Kirk's ability to bring together disparate wings of the Make America Great Again movement - members of Congress, dark arts strategists like Roger Stone and conspiracy-obsessed social media influencers. Getty Images Donald Trump Jr (l) with JD Vance (c) and Charlie Kirk (r) on stage during the Turning Point USA Inaugural Eve Ball in Washington, DC in January Ever closer to White House power Kirk's influence arguably grew even more during Trump's second term. Just two days before Trump took office, the pair played golf together in Mar-a-Lago. His relationships with Trump and the rest of the family even gave him sway over government posts - Kirk was reportedly involved in vetting administration appointees earlier this year. In his tribute, Vance wrote: ""He didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government."" And while his social media and podcast output continued at pace, along with campus tours and other speaking commitments, he continued to hew to Trump's agenda. After criticising the Justice Department for dragging its feet on releasing files related to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, he took a phone call with Trump. Shortly thereafter, Kirk declared that he was ""done talking about Epstein"". News of his killing hit the White House hard, starting with the startled gasps of young staffers who saw news of the shooting while scrolling on their phones. ""Oh my God,"" one young woman was heard saying, before scurrying down a hallway to tell others. ""Charlie Kirk has been shot!"" Watch: Charlie Kirk's speech from 2020 and interaction with Vance last year","Charlie Kirk, a college dropout who rose from an unknown activist to a prominent Maga star, was a highly influential conservative figure and a key ally to Donald Trump before his death by shooting. Alongside mentor Bill Montgomery, Kirk co-founded Turning Point USA (TPUSA) in 2012, an organization that revolutionized conservative activism on college campuses by leveraging online media and slick messaging to mobilize young people.

Kirk became a steadfast supporter of Donald Trump, serving as his bridge to young Republicans and being credited by Trump himself for significant contributions to his 2016 and 2024 election victories. He was a close friend and informal adviser to the Trump family, influencing campaign strategies, advocating for figures like JD Vance, and even reportedly playing a role in vetting government appointments during a potential second Trump term. TPUSA's ""ground game"" and innovative social media strategies were crucial in expanding conservative outreach and mobilizing voters.

Politically, Kirk held hard-right views, promoting Christian nationalism, opposing gay marriage and abortion, and being critical of Islam and diversity programs. He also spread falsehoods on topics like Covid vaccines and election fraud. Despite his loyalty to Trump, which included organizing supporters for events preceding the January 6th Capitol riot, he later tempered his public stance on election fraud and strategically shifted TPUSA's focus to maximizing early voting efforts. Never holding public office, Kirk's influence grew immensely, with TPUSA expanding to thousands of schools and generating substantial revenue. His sudden killing, by shooting, sent shockwaves through the White House.","**चार्ली किर्क: एक मागा स्टार और ट्रम्प के प्रमुख सहयोगी का दुखद अंत**

राजनीतिक रूप से, किर्क घोर दक्षिणपंथी विचार रखते थे, उन्होंने ईसाई राष्ट्रवाद को बढ़ावा दिया, समलैंगिक विवाह और गर्भपात का विरोध किया, और इस्लाम तथा विविधता कार्यक्रमों की आलोचना करते थे। उन्होंने कोविड टीकों और चुनावी धोखाधड़ी जैसे विषयों पर भी झूठी जानकारी फैलाई। ट्रम्प के प्रति उनकी वफादारी के बावजूद, जिसमें 6 जनवरी के कैपिटल दंगे से पहले की घटनाओं के लिए समर्थकों को संगठित करना शामिल था, उन्होंने बाद में चुनावी धोखाधड़ी पर अपने सार्वजनिक रुख को नरम कर दिया और रणनीतिक रूप से TPUSA का ध्यान प्रारंभिक मतदान के प्रयासों को अधिकतम करने पर केंद्रित कर दिया। उन्होंने कभी कोई सार्वजनिक पद नहीं संभाला, फिर भी किर्क का प्रभाव बहुत बढ़ गया, TPUSA हजारों स्कूलों तक फैल गया और पर्याप्त राजस्व उत्पन्न कर रहा था। गोली मारकर उनकी अचानक हत्या ने व्हाइट हाउस में सदमे की लहर भेज दी।",en,[],,Kirk's loyalty towards the first family put him at the very centre of Donald Trump's Maga movement.,[''],www.bbc.com/news/us-canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The four-year-old, who was diagnosed with Stage 4 kidney disease at birth, has spent two healthy years without any hospital visits, and is eager to be in class with friends, Ms Norwood said. But the 32-year-old mother is beginning to reconsider sending her immunocompromised son to school, after Florida's surgeon general last week announced he would try to end vaccine mandates in the state, including those for school children. ""It's just scary,"" Ms Norwood said. ""If these kids aren't vaccinated … he can get very, very sick if someone were to come in with the measles."" Medical experts and some parents worry the surgeon general's move will threaten the health of vulnerable children like Mason, setting the stage for a new era of infectious disease, driven by lower vaccine rates. ""We'll end up having pockets of outbreaks of different types of infectious diseases,"" Florida's former surgeon general, Scott Rivkees, told the BBC. ""Individuals who are older, immunocompromised adults and children who may have cancer, for example, are going to be afraid to go out into public."" If Florida goes ahead, it would be one of the first states to officially do away with childhood vaccination mandates, which have long been a fixture in parents' back-to-school plans. In April, Idaho's governor signed a law loosening vaccine requirements. These moves come as Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a vaccine sceptic, undertakes remaking US vaccine policy, and the nation's public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is in turmoil. A 'petri dish' of infections When Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced the effort earlier this month, he likened existing mandates to ""slavery"", saying that parents should ultimately have a choice. His efforts are backed by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, while leading medical organisations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, oppose the plan. Ladapo did not offer specifics, and his office did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC. But Florida's health department told the Associated Press that in 90 days, it would lift school mandates on vaccines for hepatitis B, chickenpox, Hib influenza and pneumococcal diseases. Lifting the mandates on other vaccines would require a change to the Florida Administrative Code, which would have to go through the state legislature, medical experts told the BBC. The announcement worried Meghan Bichard, a mother of two in Lake County, Florida. The 39-year-old's two children, ages eight and three, are already vaccinated but she knows several parents in her town whose children are not. ""To hear that there's going to be the potential of some of these very preventable diseases becoming a petri dish here in our location is troublesome,"" she said. ""Why wouldn't we want to protect ourselves, and why wouldn't we want to protect our neighbours?"" But Dana Fernandez, of Longwood, Florida, was ""delighted"" by Ladapo's policy. She moved with her family from New York - which does not allow religious exemptions for vaccines - to Florida, so her six-year-old unvaccinated triplets could attend public school with the waiver. ""I support a parent's right to decide for themselves what they feel is right for their child,"" she said. ""But I don't support you mandating what I should do."" A recent survey from health nonprofit KFF suggests that the vast majority - about 80% - of parents in Florida and across the US want vaccine requirements for public schools. Florida has a relatively high vaccination rate, though the number of religious exemptions for shots has grown in recent years, said Dr Rivkees, a University School of Public Health professor. As exemptions have grown, Meghan Martin, a paediatric emergency medicine doctor at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital in Florida, said she has seen more outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses in recent years. Cases of whooping cough, or pertussis, for instance, used to be rare, but are now a monthly occurrence, she said. In 2024, pertussis sickened over 700 Floridians, up from just 85 cases in 2023. The state has also seen several measles cases over the past year, as the US battled its worst outbreak of the infection in decades, leading to three deaths, including two children in Texas. Dr Martin said the policy could further lower vaccination rates in the state, leading to more severe illness and potentially overcrowding hospitals. In an interview with CNN, Ladapo said on Sunday that his department had not analysed data about how the policy change could affect outbreaks of vaccine-preventable illnesses. ""Do I need to analyze whether it's appropriate for parents to be able to decide what goes into their children's bodies? I don't need to do an analysis on that,"" he said. Florida's MAHA influence","Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo, backed by Governor Ron DeSantis, has announced plans to end childhood vaccine mandates for school attendance, a move that has sparked significant concern among medical experts and many parents.

The new policy, prioritizing ""parental choice"" and likened by Ladapo to ending ""slavery,"" will initially lift mandates for Hepatitis B, chickenpox, Hib influenza, and pneumococcal diseases within 90 days, with other vaccine requirements potentially requiring legislative changes. Ladapo's department has reportedly not analyzed the public health impact of this decision.

Medical experts, including former Florida Surgeon General Scott Rivkees and the American Academy of Pediatrics, strongly oppose the plan, warning it could usher in a ""new era of infectious disease"" driven by lower vaccination rates. Pediatric emergency doctor Meghan Martin notes an increase in vaccine-preventable illnesses like whooping cough, which surged from 85 cases in Florida in 2023 to over 700 in 2024, and recent measles outbreaks, coinciding with a rise in religious exemptions.

Parents of immunocompromised children, such as Cammi Norwood, whose son Mason is at high risk, express deep fear, contemplating keeping their children out of school. While some parents, like Dana Fernandez, support the policy as upholding parental rights, a KFF survey indicates that approximately 80% of parents in Florida and across the US want vaccine requirements.

This policy shift in Florida, one of the first states to officially do away with childhood vaccination mandates, comes as Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr., a known vaccine skeptic, influences US vaccine policy, and follows similar moves like Idaho's recent loosening of vaccine requirements for young children and pregnant women. Critics worry it will lead to more severe illnesses and strain on public health resources.","फ्लोरिडा के सर्जन जनरल जोसेफ लडापो, जिन्हें गवर्नर रॉन डीसेंटिस का समर्थन प्राप्त है, ने स्कूल में बच्चों के लिए अनिवार्य टीकाकरण को समाप्त करने की योजना की घोषणा की है। इस कदम से चिकित्सा विशेषज्ञों और कई माता-पिता के बीच काफी चिंता पैदा हो गई है।

यह नई नीति, जो ""माता-पिता की पसंद"" को प्राथमिकता देती है और जिसकी लडापो ने ""गुलामी"" खत्म करने से तुलना की है, शुरू में 90 दिनों के भीतर हेपेटाइटिस बी, चिकनपॉक्स, हिब इन्फ्लूएंजा और न्यूमोकोकल रोगों के लिए अनिवार्य टीकाकरण को समाप्त कर देगी। अन्य टीकों की आवश्यकताओं के लिए संभावित रूप से विधायी परिवर्तनों की आवश्यकता होगी। बताया गया है कि लडापो के विभाग ने इस निर्णय के जन स्वास्थ्य प्रभाव का विश्लेषण नहीं किया है।

Kirk, a 31-year-old right-wing activist, was shot dead on Wednesday during an open-air speaking event in Orem. His suspected killer, Tyler Robinson, was arrested on Thursday night after surrendering to police. In her remarks, Mrs Kirk pledged: ""My husband's voice will remain."" Turning Point USA, the organisation Kirk co-founded, has announced a memorial will take place on 21 September at State Farm Stadium in Arizona, which can seat more than 60,000 people. Shooting throws Utah students into heart of US political divide Suspected killer brought into custody after confessing to father In a livestream, standing beside her husband's empty chair that he used during podcast tapings, Mrs Kirk quoted the Bible and spoke about his love for President Donald Trump, Vice-President JD Vance, the US and the couple's two children. The broadcast, from Turning Point USA's headquarters in Arizona, began with several minutes of silence, as the camera was fixed on the empty chair. As his widow started speaking, she looked upwards and whispered a silent prayer. She then thanked first responders who tried to save him, her husband's staff, and the White House. ""Mr President, my husband loved you. And he knew that you loved him too,"" she said tearfully, also thanking Vance and his wife Usha for accompanying the casket back to Arizona. ""But most of all, Charlie loved his children. And he loved me. With all his heart. And he made sure I knew that every day."" In a later Instagram post, Mrs Kirk echoed comments she made on the livestream and shared videos and photos of her sitting over her husband's casket. One video showed her kissing Kirk's hand as he lies in the casket dressed in a suit and tie. Eric Thayer/Getty Images Erika Kirk holds hands with Second Lady Usha Vance as they arrive in Arizona on Air Force Two Addressing ""evil-doers"", Mrs Kirk, 36, had earlier told the livestream: ""You have no idea the fire that you have ignited within this wife, the cries of this widow will echo around the world like a battle cry. ""They should all know this: if you thought that my husband's mission was powerful before you have no idea, you have no idea what you just have unleashed across this entire country and this world."" Her husband's tour of US university campuses will continue throughout the autumn, and in the years to come, she said, without offering further details. His podcast will also continue. Mrs Kirk also spoke of their one-year-old son and three-year-old daughter, saying that she was at a loss for how to explain their father's sudden death. ""Baby, daddy loves you so much. Don't you worry. He's on a work trip with Jesus,"" she told their daughter. The conservative influencer who rallied a youth movement Who is Tyler Robinson, the shooting suspect? Erika Kirk is a businesswoman and former Miss Arizona USA winner, who met her husband in 2018. The couple were engaged by 2020 and wed less than a year later. She is currently studying for a doctorate in Bible studies, has launched a ministry programme and hosts the Midweek Rise Up podcast focused on Biblical leadership. Mrs Kirk also acts and models, and has a faith-based clothing line. Although the children and the couple's home life are regular fixtures on her social media pages, they never publish images showing their children's faces. Charlie Kirk, a controversial figure in US political discourse, had been hailed by many as the future of American conservatism with a knack for energising young conservatives. By mobilising the youth vote, he was an instrumental organiser in Trump's Maga coalition and helped return him to the White House for a second term. Kirk was a strong supporter of gun rights, vehemently opposed abortion, was critical of transgender rights and promoted false claims about Covid-19. His views were polarising on the college campuses, where he held large events, and his provocative speeches would draw crowds of vocal opponents as well as fans. Kirk's supporters said he was relatable and understood their concerns. But his views drew fierce liberal criticism, with his detractors said his rhetoric hurt people - especially those in the LGBT community. Young fans and critics debate Charlie Kirk's political legacy Getty Images Erika and Charlie Kirk at the Turning Point USA Ball in Washington DC in January Kirk was speaking at Utah Valley University during Turning Point USA's The American Comeback Tour, a speaking engagement that took him to several college campuses throughout the US. He was shot during his viral Prove Me Wrong debate while taking a question about gun violence and transgender people in the US. The university's president, Dr Astrid Tuminez, has confirmed both in-person and online classes will resume from 17 September. Dr Tuminez has said increased security will be implemented ""as we heal from this tragic event"". Trump has announced that he will award Kirk a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom - the highest civilian honour a president can bestow - describing his friend and ally as a ""giant of his generation and a champion of liberty"". The US president said that Mrs Kirk ""is absolutely devastated"". Trump earlier said he would be attending in person Kirk's funeral - expected to be held next weekend - in Arizona. Turning Point USA, the organisation Charlie Kirk founded when he was 18 years old, also referred to its co-founder as a ""martyr"" and ""pioneer"". ""Charlie was the ideal husband and the perfect father. Above all else, we ask you to pray for the Kirks after the incomprehensible loss they have suffered,"" the organisation said in a statement to the BBC on Thursday. JD Vance flew to Salt Lake City, Utah, on Thursday to retrieve Kirk's casket and transport it to Phoenix, Arizona - where Kirk's family lives - on the vice-presidential aircraft, Air Force Two. Vance and Second Lady Usha Vance travelled with Kirk's family and some of his friends to Arizona.","Right-wing activist and Turning Point USA co-founder, Charlie Kirk, 31, was fatally shot on Wednesday during an open-air speaking event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.

Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, 36, delivered a tearful address from Turning Point USA headquarters, vowing to prevent her husband's ""legacy"" from dying and stating his mission had been intensified. She spoke of Kirk's love for President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and their two young children, whom she consoled by saying their father was ""on a work trip with Jesus.""

दक्षिणपंथी कार्यकर्ता और टर्निंग पॉइंट यूएसए के सह-संस्थापक चार्ली किर्क (31) की बुधवार को ओरेम, यूटा में यूटा वैली यूनिवर्सिटी में एक खुले मैदान में आयोजित भाषण कार्यक्रम के दौरान गोली मारकर हत्या कर दी गई। उनके संदिग्ध हत्यारे, टायलर रॉबिन्सन को गुरुवार रात आत्मसमर्पण करने के बाद गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया; माना जा रहा है कि वह ऑस्ट्रेलिया भाग गया था।

किर्क की विधवा एरिका किर्क (36) ने टर्निंग पॉइंट यूएसए मुख्यालय से एक भावुक भाषण दिया, जिसमें उन्होंने अपने पति की ""विरासत"" को मरने से रोकने का संकल्प लिया और कहा कि उनके मिशन को और भी तीव्र कर दिया गया है। उन्होंने राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप, उपराष्ट्रपति जेडी वेंस और अपने दो छोटे बच्चों के प्रति किर्क के प्रेम के बारे में बात की, जिन्हें उन्होंने यह कहकर सांत्वना दी कि उनके पिता ""यीशु के साथ एक काम की यात्रा पर गए हैं।"" श्रीमती किर्क ने आपातकालीन सेवा कर्मियों, अपने पति के कर्मचारियों और व्हाइट हाउस को भी धन्यवाद दिया। उन्होंने घोषणा की कि किर्क का विश्वविद्यालय परिसर दौरा और पॉडकास्ट जारी रहेगा।

टर्निंग पॉइंट यूएसए ने किर्क को ""शहीद"" और ""अग्रदूत"" बताया है, और एरिज़ोना के स्टेट फ़ार्म स्टेडियम में 21 सितंबर को एक स्मारक सेवा की घोषणा की है। राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप किर्क को मरणोपरांत प्रेसिडेंशियल मेडल ऑफ़ फ़्रीडम से सम्मानित करने वाले हैं और एरिज़ोना में उनके अंतिम संस्कार में शामिल होने की योजना बना रहे हैं। उपराष्ट्रपति जेडी वेंस और सेकंड लेडी उषा वेंस पहले ही किर्क के ताबूत को वहाँ ले जा चुके हैं।

एक विवादास्पद लेकिन प्रभावशाली व्यक्ति, किर्क ट्रंप के ""मेक अमेरिका ग्रेट अगेन"" आंदोलन के लिए युवा रूढ़िवादियों को संगठित करने के लिए जाने जाते थे। उन्होंने बंदूक के अधिकारों की वकालत की, गर्भपात का विरोध किया, ट्रांसजेंडर अधिकारों की आलोचना की और कोविड-19 के बारे में झूठे दावे प्रचारित किए, जिससे अक्सर उनके कैंपस कार्यक्रमों के दौरान उत्साही समर्थकों और मुखर आलोचकों दोनों को आकर्षित किया। उन्हें बंदूक हिंसा और ट्रांसजेंडर मुद्दों से संबंधित 'प्रूव मी रॉन्ग' बहस के दौरान गोली मारी गई थी। यूटा वैली यूनिवर्सिटी ने पुष्टि की कि 17 सितंबर को बढ़ी हुई सुरक्षा के साथ कक्षाएं फिर से शुरू होंगी। एरिका किर्क, एक व्यवसायी, पूर्व मिस एरिज़ोना यूएसए और डॉक्टरेट की छात्रा होने के साथ-साथ मंत्रालय और मीडिया में भी सक्रिय हैं।",en,[],,"The organisation Kirk co-founded will host a memorial at a 60,000+ seat stadium in Arizona.",[''],www.bbc.com/news/us-canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the 31-year-old Charlie Kirk sat under a tent, debating political opponents taking their turn at a microphone, many gathered on the lawns cheered – and some protested. Seconds later, they were all running in terror. The activist was struck in the neck by a bullet, mortally wounded. The episode playing out as cameras rolled, some showing the murder in bloody detail. The images will be hard to forget - particularly for the many young conservatives for whom Kirk held celebrity status. The leader of their movement, regardless of the ultimate motive behind his killing, will now be viewed as a martyr for the cause. Kirk, in the past, had warned of what he said was the threat of violence from his critics – of which he had many, given his provocative style of conservativism. Nonetheless he was willing to travel to college campuses, where the politics frequently tilt to the left, and debate all comers. He was an advocate of gun rights and conservative values, an outspoken critic of transgender rights, and a staunch, unapologetic Donald Trump supporter. His Turning Point US organisation played a key role in the voter turnout drive that saw the president return to the White House this year. The tent where he was shot had ""prove me wrong"" emblazoned on it. He was a hero to young conservative students in particular, meeting them where they were and offering them a movement of their own. Kirk's killing is both another episode of shocking gun violence in America – and the latest in an ever-lengthening line of recent political violence. Earlier this year two Democratic state legislators in Minnesota were shot in their homes – with one dying from her wounds. Last year, Donald Trump was twice the target of assassination attempts. His brush with a bullet at an outdoor rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, bears striking similarities to Wednesday's shooting in Utah – both playing out before gathered crowds at outdoor venues. Two years before that, a hammer-wielding assailant broke in to the home of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a prominent Democrat. In 2017, a man opened fire on Republican congressmen practising on a northern Virginia baseball field. It is difficult to divine where American politics goes from here, but the trajectory is bleak. Violence begets violence. Increasingly divisive rhetoric, fuelled by social media echo chambers and easy access to firearms, leads to raw nerves and a heightened potential for bloodshed. Watch: Shouting erupts during moment of silence for Charlie Kirk Conservative activists are reconsidering what security measures are necessary for public appearances, just as many local politicians did after the Minnesota shootings. But the Butler attempt on Trump's life was nearly successful, despite trained local and federal security forces on the scene. If there is a sense that no-one is safe – that public life itself has become a blood sport – that will have its own corrosive effect on American politics. Trump, in a video address from the Oval Office posted on his Truth Social website on Wednesday night, called the killing a ""dark moment for America"". But he wasted little time in blaming the ""radical left"" for Kirk's murder. He ticked through some of the recent instances of political violence - those that targeted conservatives - and said his administration would find ""each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence"". Those comments are sure to be welcomed by those on the right who in the hours after the shooting called for a crackdown on left-wing groups. ""It is time, within the confines of the law, to infiltrate, disrupt, arrest and incarcerate all of those who are responsible for this chaos,"" conservative activist Christopher Rufo wrote on X. Watch: 'This is a political assassination', says Utah governor Many prominent Republicans and Democrats, including potential 2028 presidential contenders, lined up to condemn political violence and call for a cooling of rhetoric. But in Congress on Wednesday evening, a moment of silence for Kirk was quickly followed by a shouting match between lawmakers - a further indication that partisan tensions are still high. Meanwhile, in Utah, witnesses, law enforcement and state and local leaders continue to come to grips with the trauma of the day. In emotional remarks during a press conference, Governor Spencer Cox – who has frequently spoken out against overheated political rhetoric and political divisiveness – described a nation, soon to celebrate a milestone anniversary of its founding, that is ""broken"". ""Is this it?"" he asked. ""Is this what 250 years has wrought upon us?"" ""I pray that is not the case,"" he answered. The doubt in his voice underscored the simple truth that, on this day, the future of America and whether its violent politics can be fixed seems far from certain.","The killing of prominent conservative activist and staunch Donald Trump ally, Charlie Kirk, at a Utah college campus has underscored America's increasingly volatile and fractured political landscape. Kirk, 31, founder of the influential Turning Point US organization, was fatally shot in the neck by a single bullet while debating political opponents in front of thousands of students. The shocking incident, partly captured on camera, has led many young conservatives to view him as a martyr for the cause.

Kirk, an outspoken advocate for gun rights and conservative values, and a fierce critic of transgender rights, often sought out debates on left-leaning college campuses despite having warned of potential violence from critics. His organization played a key role in recent voter turnout efforts for former President Trump.

The shooting is not an isolated event but rather the latest in a worrying surge of political violence across America. Previous incidents include the shooting of two Democratic state legislators in Minnesota earlier this year (one fatal), two assassination attempts on Donald Trump last year (one at an outdoor rally mirroring Kirk's shooting), a hammer attack on then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's home, and a 2017 shooting targeting Republican congressmen. Experts attribute this escalating violence to increasingly divisive rhetoric, fueled by social media echo chambers and easy access to firearms, creating a ""bleak"" trajectory for American politics.

In the immediate aftermath, President Trump condemned the killing as a ""dark moment"" but swiftly blamed the ""radical left,"" vowing to find those responsible. His comments were echoed by some conservative activists who called for a crackdown on left-wing groups. While many prominent Republicans and Democrats condemned political violence and urged a cooling of rhetoric, a moment of silence for Kirk in Congress was quickly followed by a shouting match, highlighting persistent partisan tensions. Utah Governor Spencer Cox emotionally described a ""broken"" nation, expressing profound doubt about America's ability to overcome its violent political divisions.

Conservative activists are now re-evaluating security measures for public appearances. The incident has raised fears that public life itself is becoming a ""blood sport,"" threatening to further corrode American politics and leaving the nation's future uncertain.","प्रमुख रूढ़िवादी कार्यकर्ता और डोनाल्ड ट्रंप के कट्टर समर्थक चार्ली कर्क की यूटा के एक कॉलेज परिसर में हत्या ने अमेरिका के तेजी से अस्थिर और खंडित राजनीतिक परिदृश्य को रेखांकित किया है। 31 वर्षीय कर्क, जो प्रभावशाली टर्निंग पॉइंट यूएस संगठन के संस्थापक थे, को हजारों छात्रों के सामने राजनीतिक विरोधियों से बहस करते समय गर्दन में एक गोली मारकर मौत के घाट उतार दिया गया। कैमरे में आंशिक रूप से कैद हुई इस चौंकाने वाली घटना के बाद कई युवा रूढ़िवादी उन्हें 'मकसद के लिए शहीद' मानने लगे हैं।

कर्क, जो बंदूक अधिकारों और रूढ़िवादी मूल्यों के मुखर समर्थक थे, और ट्रांसजेंडर अधिकारों के कटु आलोचक थे, अक्सर आलोचकों से संभावित हिंसा की चेतावनी के बावजूद वाम-झुकाव वाले कॉलेज परिसरों में बहस की तलाश करते थे। उनके संगठन ने पूर्व राष्ट्रपति ट्रंप के लिए हाल के मतदाता भागीदारी प्रयासों में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाई थी।

यह गोलीबारी कोई अकेली घटना नहीं है, बल्कि अमेरिका भर में राजनीतिक हिंसा की चिंताजनक वृद्धि की नवीनतम कड़ी है। पिछली घटनाओं में इस साल की शुरुआत में मिनेसोटा में दो डेमोक्रेटिक राज्य विधायकों पर गोलीबारी (एक की मौत), पिछले साल डोनाल्ड ट्रंप पर दो हत्या के प्रयास (एक बाहरी रैली में, जो कर्क की गोलीबारी से मिलती-जुलती थी), तत्कालीन हाउस स्पीकर नैन्सी पेलोसी के घर पर हथौड़े से हमला, और 2017 में रिपब्लिकन कांग्रेसियों को निशाना बनाकर की गई गोलीबारी शामिल है। विशेषज्ञ इस बढ़ती हिंसा को तेजी से विभाजनकारी बयानबाजी, सोशल मीडिया इको चैंबरों द्वारा बढ़ावा और आग्नेयास्त्रों तक आसान पहुंच से जोड़ते हैं, जो अमेरिकी राजनीति के लिए एक ""निराशाजनक"" मार्ग का निर्माण कर रहा है।

तत्काल बाद, राष्ट्रपति ट्रंप ने इस हत्या को ""अंधेरा क्षण"" बताते हुए निंदा की, लेकिन तुरंत इसका दोष ""कट्टरपंथी वामपंथियों"" पर मढ़ दिया और जिम्मेदार लोगों को ढूंढ निकालने की कसम खाई। उनकी टिप्पणियों को कुछ रूढ़िवादी कार्यकर्ताओं ने भी दोहराया, जिन्होंने वामपंथी समूहों पर नकेल कसने का आह्वान किया। जबकि कई प्रमुख रिपब्लिकन और डेमोक्रेट्स ने राजनीतिक हिंसा की निंदा की और बयानबाजी में नरमी लाने का आग्रह किया, कांग्रेस में कर्क के लिए एक मिनट के मौन के तुरंत बाद गरमागरम बहस छिड़ गई, जो लगातार पक्षपातपूर्ण तनावों को उजागर करती है। यूटा के गवर्नर स्पेंसर कॉक्स ने भावनात्मक रूप से एक ""टूटे हुए"" राष्ट्र का वर्णन किया, और अमेरिका की अपनी हिंसक राजनीतिक विभाजनों पर काबू पाने की क्षमता के बारे में गहरा संदेह व्यक्त किया।

रूढ़िवादी कार्यकर्ता अब सार्वजनिक प्रदर्शनों के लिए सुरक्षा उपायों का पुनर्मूल्यांकन कर रहे हैं। इस घटना ने इस डर को बढ़ा दिया है कि सार्वजनिक जीवन स्वयं एक ""खूनी खेल"" बनता जा रहा है, जिससे अमेरिकी राजनीति और अधिक कमजोर हो सकती है और राष्ट्र का भविष्य अनिश्चित हो सकता है।",en,[],,Charlie Kirk's killing is another episode of gun violence in America and the latest in a line of recent political violence.,[''],www.bbc.com/news/us-canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Public records reviewed by the BBC suggest Robinson had in the past registered as an unaffiliated, or nonpartisan, voter in Utah. His parents, Matthew Carl Robinson and Amber Denise Robinson are registered Republicans, according to state records. People who lived in the Robinsons' Washington, Utah, neighbourhood told the BBC he had a good reputation in the community. One neighbour, who asked the BBC not to publish her name, called his parents ""amazing"" and hard workers. The family was Mormon, she said. Tyler Robinson, who had an apartment in St. George near his family home, was not enrolled at UVU, the site of the shooting. In a statement, the Utah Board of Higher Education said Tyler James Robinson was a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship programme at Dixie Technical College. ""He previously spent one semester at Utah State University in 2021 and earned concurrent enrolment credits through Utah Tech University while in high school between 2019 and 2021,"" it added. Social media accounts indicate Robinson's father runs a kitchen countertop and cabinet installation business, while his mother is a social worker. The family is Mormon and active in the local church. Utah governor details how Charlie Kirk murder suspect apprehended","Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old Utah native, has been identified and arrested as the suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk on September 10 at Utah Valley University. Robinson is accused of aggravated murder and is also suspected of shooting another man in the head.

His apprehension on September 12, following a 33-hour manhunt, was significantly aided by his father. After recognizing his son from law enforcement images and being confronted by police, Robinson's father persuaded him to surrender and also contacted a youth pastor who then alerted the US Marshals.

Robinson is currently held without bail at Utah County Jail, where he is on special watch. An affidavit confirms his arrest on suspicion of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, and obstruction of justice. Formal charges are anticipated to be filed on Tuesday, when he is also scheduled for his first court appearance.

FBI officials have declined to discuss Robinson's background, political leanings, or a possible motive, stating the investigation is ongoing. However, a family member told investigators Robinson had become ""more political"" recently and discussed his dislike for Kirk's viewpoints during a dinner conversation prior to the attack. Public records indicate Robinson had registered as an unaffiliated voter, while his parents are registered Republicans and Democrats.

Robinson, a student in an electrical apprenticeship program, has no prior convictions or history of violent offenses. His family is Mormon and described as having a good reputation in their community. The shooting has been noted for thrusting Utah students into the heart of the US political divide.","यहाँ अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद दिया गया है:

22 वर्षीय उटाह निवासी टायलर रॉबिन्सन की पहचान 10 सितंबर को उटाह वैली यूनिवर्सिटी में रूढ़िवादी कार्यकर्ता चार्ली किर्क की जानलेवा गोलीबारी के संदिग्ध के रूप में की गई है और उसे गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया है। रॉबिन्सन पर जघन्य हत्या (aggravated murder) का आरोप है और उस पर एक अन्य व्यक्ति के सिर में गोली मारने का भी संदेह है।

33 घंटे के तलाशी अभियान के बाद 12 सितंबर को हुई उसकी गिरफ्तारी में उसके पिता ने महत्वपूर्ण योगदान दिया। पुलिस द्वारा जारी तस्वीरों से अपने बेटे को पहचानने और पुलिस से संपर्क किए जाने के बाद, रॉबिन्सन के पिता ने उसे आत्मसमर्पण करने के लिए मनाया। उन्होंने एक युवा पादरी से भी संपर्क किया, जिसने बाद में यूएस मार्शलों को सूचित किया।

रॉबिन्सन को वर्तमान में यूटा काउंटी जेल में बिना जमानत के हिरासत में रखा गया है, जहां उस पर विशेष निगरानी रखी जा रही है। एक हलफनामे (affidavit) से उसकी गिरफ्तारी की पुष्टि होती है, जिसमें उस पर जघन्य हत्या, आग्नेयास्त्र के आपराधिक उपयोग (felony discharge of a firearm) और न्याय में बाधा डालने (obstruction of justice) का संदेह है। मंगलवार को औपचारिक आरोप दायर किए जाने की उम्मीद है, जब उसकी पहली अदालत में पेशी भी निर्धारित है।

एफबीआई अधिकारियों ने यह कहते हुए रॉबिन्सन की पृष्ठभूमि, राजनीतिक झुकाव या संभावित मकसद पर चर्चा करने से इनकार कर दिया है कि जांच जारी है। हालांकि, एक पारिवारिक सदस्य ने जांचकर्ताओं को बताया कि रॉबिन्सन हाल ही में ""अधिक राजनीतिक"" हो गया था और हमले से पहले एक रात के खाने की बातचीत के दौरान किर्क के विचारों के प्रति अपनी नापसंदगी पर चर्चा की थी। सार्वजनिक रिकॉर्ड बताते हैं कि रॉबिन्सन ने एक निर्दलीय मतदाता (unaffiliated voter) के रूप में पंजीकरण कराया था, जबकि उसके माता-पिता पंजीकृत रिपब्लिकन और डेमोक्रेट हैं।

इलेक्ट्रिकल अप्रेंटिसशिप कार्यक्रम का छात्र रॉबिन्सन का कोई आपराधिक रिकॉर्ड या हिंसक अपराधों का इतिहास नहीं है। उसका परिवार मॉर्मन है और समुदाय में उनकी अच्छी प्रतिष्ठा बताई जाती है। इस गोलीबारी ने यूटा के छात्रों को अमेरिकी राजनीतिक ध्रुवीकरण के केंद्र में ला खड़ा किया है।",en,[],,The FBI says a family member recognised the 22-year-old man from Utah from surveillance images released to the public.,[''],www.bbc.com/news/us-canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pastor, who also serves as a court security officer, later called the US Marshals, who detained the suspect at around 22:00 local time on Thursday. Utah's Governor Spencer Cox said surveillance images showed Mr Robinson arriving on the campus of Utah Valley University around four hours before a shot rang out, killing Kirk and sending students running for cover. Cox told journalists that when Mr Robinson was taken into custody, he was wearing clothing similar to what was seen on CCTV cameras at the scene of the shooting. The governor added that investigators had interviewed a family member, who said the suspect had become more political in recent years. Cox said the family member had spoken of a recent incident when Mr Robinson had mentioned that Kirk was coming to Utah and that he ""was full of hate and spreading hate"". BBC reports from Utah home linked to Charlie Kirk shooting suspect Cox said investigators had also spoken to a roommate of the suspect who had shown them exchanges of messages with an account named ""Tyler"" on the messaging app Discord. The messages referred to a need to retrieve a rifle from ""a drop point"" and the firearm being left in a bush, wrapped in a towel. The FBI said on Thursday that they had found the suspected weapon - an imported Mauser .30-06 bolt action rifle - wrapped in a towel in a wooded area near campus. Cox told reporters that inscriptions had been found engraved on casings recovered with the rifle, which had a scope mounted on top of it. The inscriptions included ""hey fascist! CATCH!"" and ""O Bella ciao, Bella ciao"". ""Bella ciao"" means ""goodbye beautiful"" in Italian. It is also the title of a song dedicated to the Italian resistance that fought against the occupying troops of Nazi Germany. Utah's governor said he was not aware of any potential further arrests in the investigation. State prosecutors said they planned to file formal charges against Mr Robinson on Tuesday.

उसके पिता ने एक युवा पादरी की मदद से रॉबिन्सन को आत्महत्या करने के बजाय खुद को पुलिस के हवाले करने के लिए राजी किया, जिसके बाद उन्होंने उसकी हिरासत के लिए अमेरिकी मार्शलों से संपर्क किया। इस गिरफ्तारी की घोषणा अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप ने की, जिन्होंने संदिग्ध को मौत की सज़ा दिए जाने की मांग की।

गवर्नर स्पेंसर कॉक्स ने खुलासा किया कि निगरानी फुटेज से पता चला है कि गोलीबारी से घंटों पहले रॉबिन्सन परिसर में मौजूद था, और उसने ऐसे कपड़े पहने थे जो सीसीटीवी में देखे गए कपड़ों के समान थे। जांचकर्ताओं को रॉबिन्सन के रूममेट के संदेश भी मिले, जिनमें एक ""ड्रॉप पॉइंट"" से राइफल निकालने की बात कही गई थी। एफबीआई ने बाद में संदिग्ध हथियार, एक इम्पोर्टेड मौज़र .30-06 बोल्ट एक्शन राइफल, परिसर के पास एक जंगली इलाके में एक तौलिए में लिपटी हुई पाई। राइफल के साथ बरामद कारतूस के खोखों पर राजनीतिक संदेश खुदे हुए थे, जिनमें ""हे फ़ासीवादी!"" और ""ओ बेला चाओ, बेला चाओ"" शामिल थे, जो बाद वाला एक इतालवी नाज़ी-विरोधी प्रतिरोध गीत का संदर्भ देता है। एक परिवार के सदस्य ने जांचकर्ताओं को बताया कि रॉबिन्सन हाल के वर्षों में तेजी से राजनीतिक हो गया था, और उसका मानना था कि किर्क ""नफरत से भरा हुआ था और नफरत फैला रहा था।""

इस हत्या ने अमेरिकियों को गहरा सदमा पहुंचाया है और देश के तीखे पक्षपातपूर्ण विभाजनों को उजागर किया है। किर्क की विधवा ने कहा है कि वह ""तुम्हारी विरासत को कभी मरने नहीं दूंगी।""

राज्य अभियोजक मंगलवार को रॉबिन्सन के खिलाफ औपचारिक आरोप दायर करने की योजना बना रहे हैं, जिनमें गंभीर हत्या (aggravated murder), न्याय में बाधा डालना, और हथियार का आपराधिक इस्तेमाल शामिल हैं। जांच जारी है, और अधिकारी फिलहाल आगे किसी और गिरफ्तारी की उम्मीद नहीं कर रहे हैं।",en,[],,Tyler Robinson is accused of shooting the right-wing activist while he was speaking at a university in Utah on Wednesday.,[''],www.bbc.com/news/us-canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And behind the wheel is often a turbaned Sikh man, their cabs adorned with religious symbols, portraits of Sikh Gurus, or posters of Punjabi singers. Sikhs, a religious minority group from India, have become a large part of America's trucking industry, helping to deliver everything from California strawberries to lumber across the country. But a crash in Florida and its aftermath have sent shivers through the Sikh trucking community that could have economic consequences. There are approximately 750,000 Sikhs in America, and about 150,000 working in the trucking industry, mostly as drivers. The role they play in this essential industry is evident from the names on their trucks' doors - Singh Trucking, Punjab Trucking - to the curry served at rest stops along the west coast, where approximately 40% of all truck drivers are Sikh, according to the North American Punjabi Trucking Association. Many have limited English skills but years of driving experience. This has put some drivers in a precarious position, as the Trump administration has moved to tighten language requirements for commercial drivers. In response, many Sikh temples are offering language classes to help drivers pass their language tests. ""Many drivers stayed home out of fear of the new laws. We started the class in mid-July, to help them return to work,"" said Tejpaul Singh Bainiwal, who volunteers with a Sikh temple in Stockton, California. At an English class at the temple on Sunday, several drivers practised introductions and reviewed highway signs and regulatory signs. Many drivers felt shy about speaking but were motivated. Narinder Singh, a 51-year-old driver who has been working in America for eight years, says he's taking classes at the temple in Stockton because he thinks it's important to try to be a good citizen, and comply with the law. ""Sometimes an individual's actions may cost the entire community,"" he said, referencing a fatal crash on the other side of the country that has shone a harsh spotlight on Sikh drivers in California. A tragic crash shakes the industry On 12 August, Harjinder Singh, an Indian-born truck driver, made a U-turn on the Florida Turnpike, crashing into a minivan and killing three people. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has claimed he entered the US illegally from Mexico in 2018 and obtained a Commercial Driver's License (CDL) in California, despite having no legal right to be in the United States and failing an English proficiency exam. However, California officials say federal authorities told them he had a legal work permit when the state issued him a driver's licence. Harjinder now faces manslaughter and vehicular homicide charges in Florida and has been denied bail. His arraignment is slated for the end of September. The crash has had a ripple effect on Sikh truck drivers. Two weeks after the Florida crash, Secretary of State Marco Rubio paused the issuing of work visas for foreigners looking to become commercial truck drivers in the United States. There has also been an uptick in harassment against Sikh drivers, industry insiders tell the BBC. Raman Singh Dhillon, chief executive officer of North American Punjabi Trucking Association, said many drivers are now afraid of becoming targets. ""Sikh drivers are being harassed at truck stops. In some cases, even local law enforcement has been unresponsive,"" he says. While he supports Trump's calls for more regulation of commercial licenses, and English proficiency requirements, Raman is concerned that harassment and increasingly strict immigration laws will make it harder for Sikhs to work in the industry. ""The trucking industry will soon face a serious driver shortage,"" he said. It's a concern shared by many. Gurpratap Singh Sandhu, who runs a Sacramento-based trucking company, reveals his cousin, a US citizen truck driver, was harassed last week in Florida just because of his ethnicity. ""People honk at Sikh truckers or throw water bottles at truck stops. They're being ridiculed and harassed. They're being called by racial slurs, like 'diaper-head' and 'towel-head', referring to their turbans,"" Gurpratap says. He worries about his drivers' security. The harassment impacts Gurpratap's business directly. ""Sikh drivers in my company are scared to go to Florida, Alabama, and Arkansas because of Immigration and Customs raids after the Florida crash,"" Gurpratap said, adding that immigrant drivers were once hailed as warriors during the pandemic, when supply backlogs made the value of the industry evident. Arjun Sethi, a law professor at George Washington University, said that the social media accounts in the United States and India, as well as some politicians, have used this tragedy to target the entire Sikh community. ""This episode should be treated as a singular, tragic event and not be weaponized to target the entire Sikh community,"" Arjun said. He also worries that rhetoric may lead to violence. ""We have seen for years how inflammatory rhetoric can lead to violence against those same communities. Sikhs have already faced this in the 2012 Wisconsin Sikh Temple mass shooting, in which six Sikhs were killed"", Arjun added. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's 2024 annual hate crime statistics show Sikhs remain the third most-targeted religious group behind the Jewish and Muslim communities. Following the crash, Special US Envoy Richard Grenell met with a group of Sikh representatives in Sacramento and took to social media to decry verbal attacks against Sikhs as ""un-American"" behavior. Gagandeep Singh Raman Singh Dhillon, CEO of the North American Punjabi Trucker Association, and his wife Rupinder Kaur teach drivers in Stockton Learning in sacred spaces","Sikh truck drivers across the U.S. are experiencing heightened fear and harassment following a fatal Florida crash involving Harjinder Singh, a Sikh driver who allegedly entered the country illegally and failed an English proficiency exam. Sikhs, a religious minority from India, constitute a significant portion—approximately 40%—of America's 150,000 truck drivers.

The incident, where Singh made a U-turn resulting in three deaths and now faces manslaughter charges, has led to a pause in work visas for foreign truck drivers and intensified scrutiny. This has fueled an uptick in harassment, with Sikh drivers reporting verbal abuse, racial slurs, and intimidation at truck stops, making some hesitant to drive in certain states.

The situation is compounded by existing efforts to tighten language requirements for commercial driver's licenses (CDLs), creating a precarious position for many drivers with limited English skills. In response, Sikh temples are offering affordable English classes to help drivers pass these tests and comply with regulations.

However, community leaders and experts warn that this tragedy is being ""weaponized"" to unfairly target the entire Sikh community, raising concerns that inflammatory rhetoric could escalate to violence, referencing past hate crimes. Industry leaders also fear that increased harassment and stricter immigration laws will exacerbate a looming national driver shortage. Special U.S. Envoy Richard Grenell has condemned attacks against Sikhs as ""un-American,"" while the community continues its efforts to support its drivers.","यहां अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

अमेरिका भर में सिख ट्रक ड्राइवर फ्लोरिडा में एक घातक दुर्घटना के बाद अत्यधिक भय और उत्पीड़न का सामना कर रहे हैं। इस दुर्घटना में हरजिंदर सिंह नामक एक सिख ड्राइवर शामिल था, जिसने कथित तौर पर अवैध रूप से देश में प्रवेश किया था और अंग्रेजी दक्षता परीक्षा में फेल हो गया था। भारत से आया एक धार्मिक अल्पसंख्यक, सिख समुदाय, अमेरिका के 1.5 लाख ट्रक ड्राइवरों में से लगभग 40% का एक महत्वपूर्ण हिस्सा है।

इस घटना में, जहां सिंह ने यू-टर्न लिया था जिसके परिणामस्वरूप तीन लोगों की मौत हो गई, और अब उस पर गैर इरादतन हत्या का आरोप है, विदेशी ट्रक ड्राइवरों के लिए कार्य वीजा पर रोक लगा दी गई है और जांच तेज कर दी गई है। इससे उत्पीड़न में वृद्धि हुई है, सिख ड्राइवरों ने ट्रक स्टॉप पर मौखिक दुर्व्यवहार, नस्लीय गालियों और धमकी की सूचना दी है, जिससे कुछ ड्राइवर कुछ राज्यों में गाड़ी चलाने से झिझक रहे हैं।

वाणिज्यिक ड्राइवर लाइसेंस (CDL) के लिए भाषा आवश्यकताओं को सख्त करने के मौजूदा प्रयासों से यह स्थिति और भी जटिल हो गई है, जिससे अंग्रेजी भाषा पर सीमित पकड़ रखने वाले कई ड्राइवरों के लिए एक अनिश्चित स्थिति पैदा हो गई है। इसके जवाब में, सिख गुरुद्वारे ड्राइवरों को इन परीक्षाओं को पास करने और नियमों का पालन करने में मदद करने के लिए सस्ती अंग्रेजी कक्षाएं प्रदान कर रहे हैं।

हालांकि, समुदाय के नेताओं और विशेषज्ञों ने चेतावनी दी है कि इस त्रासदी को पूरे सिख समुदाय को अनुचित रूप से निशाना बनाने के लिए ""हथियार बनाया जा रहा है""। उन्होंने चिंता व्यक्त की है कि भड़काऊ बयानबाजी हिंसा में बदल सकती है, पिछले घृणा अपराधों का हवाला देते हुए। उद्योग के नेताओं को भी डर है कि बढ़ते उत्पीड़न और सख्त आव्रजन कानून, देश में ड्राइवरों की आसन्न कमी को और बढ़ा देंगे। अमेरिका के विशेष दूत रिचर्ड ग्रेनेल ने सिखों के खिलाफ हमलों को ""गैर-अमेरिकी"" करार देते हुए निंदा की है, जबकि समुदाय अपने ड्राइवरों का समर्थन करने के अपने प्रयासों को जारी रखे हुए है।",en,[],,Sikh truck drivers say they've experienced an uptick in harassment after a fatal crash thrust them into the national spotlight.,[''],www.bbc.com/news/us-canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, the last 48 hours have left residents wondering how the portal to the most beautiful parts of the country may have produced one of its ugliest acts of political violence in years. Tyler Robinson, the man authorities accused of killing the conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University this week, resided in the area, according to police. He is now in custody after his father apparently persuaded him to surrender. Local and federal law enforcement officers descended on typically quiet blocks in Washington and nearby St George, banging on doors and closing off streets as they carried out a high-stakes investigation. Outside the Robinson family home in Washington, neighbours expressed shock that a fellow resident could have committed such an attack. ""It shakes up a community because you don't expect it,"" said Addi Jacobson, 20, who recently moved into her grandmother's house in the neighbourhood. Ms Jacobson said she did not personally know the Robinson family, but her grandmother did. ""She just was saying that she thinks that, from what she's seen and what she knows, they're a great family, just regular citizens,"" Ms Jacobson said. ""She used the words, 'very patriotic people'."" ""We knew their family. Our whole neighbourhood is so close,"" said another neighbour who lives around the corner. She asked the BBC not use her name due to the heated political and online discussion around Mr Kirk's murder. The woman recalled Tyler Robinson ""was a pretty quiet kid"", though his younger brothers were more involved in community activities and sports. She called his mother ""an amazing parent"" and his father ""a hard worker"". Both occasionally attended a nearby Mormon church, she said. ""That just even goes to show, you can be an amazing parent, and your kid still just chooses what they choose,"" said the neighbour. ""This is a good family,"" Utah Governor Spencer Cox told CNN on Saturday. ""A normal childhood. All of those things that, that you would hope would never lead to something like this. And sadly, it did."" On 10 September, Charlie Kirk was shot in front of hundreds of students and observers, and later pronounced dead at the hospital. Videos of the carnage spread across social media, and President Donald Trump, Vice-President JD Vance, and leaders of both major US political parties condemned the assassination. ""If you thought that my husband's mission was powerful before, you have no idea. You have no idea what you just have unleashed across this entire country,"" the activist's wife, Erika Kirk, said in her first public statement on Friday evening. Searching for clues about Tyler Robinson in his home town","Conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot on September 10 at Utah Valley University, an act that has left his hometown of Washington, Utah, reeling in disbelief. Local resident Tyler Robinson has been accused of the killing and is now in custody, reportedly surrendering after his father's persuasion and believed to be with the FBI in New York.

The typically quiet community of Washington, known for its scenic surroundings, is grappling with shock over what residents call an ""ugly act of political violence."" Neighbors, many of whom knew the Robinson family, expressed profound surprise, describing them as ""great,"" ""regular citizens,"" and ""very patriotic people."" Tyler Robinson himself was recalled as a ""pretty quiet kid,"" while his parents were praised as an ""amazing parent"" and ""hard worker,"" with the family occasionally attending a local Mormon church. This stark contrast between their perceived normalcy and the heinous crime has deeply shaken the community.

Staff and some 75 cats and dogs were evacuated from the Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter in Billings, Montana, when the building filled with smoke on Wednesday. The incinerator is usually used by animal control officers to dispose of euthanised animals, but local authorities said it can also be used by law enforcement to burn seized narcotics. The cats and dogs have been relocated, and the animals which experienced the most smoke exposure are now under supervision. The incident was caused when smoke was pushed in the wrong direction because of negative pressure, according to Assistant City Administrator Kevin Iffland. Shelter executive director Triniti Halverson said she was unaware that a drug burn was happening. ""I can firmly and confidently say that, as the Executive Director, I did not know that they were disposing of extremely dangerous narcotics onsite,"" she wrote in a statement. ""My team and my animals had been confirmed to have been exposed to meth,"" she said. Before evacuating themselves, many employees put on masks and helped get the animals out. Some staff were exposed to the smoke for more than an hour, and several began to feel sick. All 14 went to the emergency room, where they spent about three hours in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber to combat the effects of smoke inhalation.

Will that be the King's ace card when he visits?,"Trump's coming to Britain. He'll get a spectacular royal welcome but no cheering crowds 1 day ago Share Save Sean Coughlan Royal correspondent Share Save BBC US President Donald Trump is going to be greeted with a spectacular royal charm offensive during his state visit this week. The aim will be to dazzle and flatter him with the ultimate red-carpet experience, with guards of honour, flypasts, historic carriages, a lavish banquet, pomp and pageantry. In return, Sir Keir Starmer will be hoping this gilt-edged reception will help to deliver the UK's message on awkward issues such as Ukraine and trade tariffs. And if anyone can get the US president's attention and influence him, surely King Charles III and the Royal Family can. Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images Queen Elizabeth II greeted the President and First Lady on the state visit to the UK in 2019 But how will King Charles handle his sometimes unpredictable guest in Windsor? Can he be the Trump whisperer? ""Trump loves the monarchy and the Royal Family. It's a potential diplomatic ace card for the UK government,"" says Anna Whitelock, professor of history of the modern monarchy at City St George's, University of London. This attraction to royalty will give the King a ""rare advantage"" in dealing with Trump, who usually expects to have the upper hand, says Prof Whitelock. Sir Anthony Seldon, biographer of the UK's prime ministers, agrees. The King can benefit from Trump's ""palpable enthusiasm"" for the royals, he says. ""At the same time, King Charles is in the most delicate of positions. His own known views, on the environment, and standing up for democracy and the rule of law in Europe, are a long way apart from the president's,"" says Sir Anthony. ""He will, I am sure, be scrupulously correct and civil,"" he adds. In essence, the King will stick to the script given to him by the UK government. The government will certainly hope that this week's royal schmooze-fest will make a positive impression on Trump, creating a feelgood factor for the UK. It's an unusual and carefully crafted state visit. There's a crammed schedule squeezed into a day and a half, most of it dedicated to royal spectacles. Windsor is being used like a royal theme park. With fears over security and protests, there won't be any cheering crowds and no public procession, like the one recently enjoyed by France's President Emmanuel Macron. Instead, it will be helicopters and closed events, including the carriage ride, which will wind its way inside the Windsor estate. A YouGov poll over the summer showed opinion divided on whether Trump's visit should go ahead, with slightly more wanting it cancelled. And the nearest thing to the public that the president will see will be the staff working at the banquet. Jonathan Brady/Getty Images The King has shown his public support for Ukraine's President Zelensky The King will make a speech in honour of the president at the state banquet in St George's Hall, inside Windsor Castle. He's likely to praise the special relationship and talk of the anniversaries of wartime alliances, perhaps mentioning his mother, the late Queen, and Trump's mother, who so admired royalty. Every word will have been written in close consultation with the government, anxious to hit the right notes. Guests, including many celebrity faces, will dine on a showcase of US and British food, from a menu written in French, with five or six different glasses for each place, in a hall lined with royal portraits and suits of armour. Charles has decades of experience at playing host. Whatever his own private thoughts - and he's not exactly going to be signed up to Trump's ""drill, baby, drill"" message - the King has a strong sense of duty and will work hard to make this visit a success. Royal author Robert Hardman suggests they'll stick to safe topics - such as talking about the president's Scottish roots. And the royals have, of course, had plenty of visits from people with whom they might not have seen eye-to-eye. Mr Hardman describes how the late Queen Elizabeth II once hid behind a bush rather than bump into Romania's President Caecescu in the palace gardens, during the dictator's state visit in 1978. Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images There will be no public carriage rides for the US visit, unlike for President Macron The King is also not alone. The rest of the Royal Family will be deployed to help with the hospitality. All eyes will be on Catherine, the Princess of Wales, and the First Lady, Melania Trump, when they visit a nature project involving the Scouts on Thursday. Trump is also an admirer of Prince William, praising their ""great, great talk"" in France at the re-opening of the Notre-Dame Cathedral. William and Catherine will be an important part of the ceremonial welcome on Wednesday. Queen Camilla will show Melania one of the quirkier items in Windsor, a remarkable dolls' house, made a century ago by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. If things get too tough, the miniature wine bottles in the dolls' house have real drink inside. Getty Images The Princess of Wales at the state banquet for Trump in 2019 While King Charles and Trump might seem contrasting personalities, they're very much known quantities to each other. They're men of the same post-war generation - Trump aged 79 and the King aged 76 - who have overlapped for decades. As far back as the late-1980s, Charles had been to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. After Trump survived an assassination attempt last July, the King sent him a personal note. They spent time together during Trump's previous state visit in 2019. And it's also not just the two heads of state who have crossed paths, but their families. Before Trump had taken a run at the White House, his businessman brother Robert, who died in 2020, had been a significant donor to Charles's charities, bringing him to royal dinners in the UK, along with other wealthy US socialites. The King's brother, Prince Andrew, had visited Mar-a-Lago in 2000, introducing himself as ""Andrew York"" to guests. Jeffrey Epstein, later convicted as a sex offender, and Ghislaine Maxwell were pictured at the same party. Prince Andrew will be entirely airbrushed out of this week's visit. But for Trump's 2019 visit, he was described as Buckingham Palace's ""secret weapon"", accompanying the president on two of the three days. That was only a matter of months before the Duke of York's notorious Newsnight interview. Trump clearly relished meeting the late Queen Elizabeth II and he'll pay his respects to her, laying a wreath on her tomb in St George's Chapel. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images Sir Keir Starmer handed over the historic invitation to a second state visit Trump's fascination with the monarchy is at the heart of this state visit. As with much about the president, it's about his personality more than his politics. ""I still remember my mother, who is Scottish by birth, sitting in front of the television set to watch Queen Elizabeth's coronation and not budging for an entire day. She was just enthralled by the pomp and circumstance, the whole idea of royalty and glamour,"" Trump recalled in his book The Art of the Deal. ""I also remember my father that day, pacing around impatiently. 'For Christ's sake Mary,' he'd say. 'Enough is enough, turn it off.'"" It seems to be his mother's voice that he listened to. ""A meeting with the Queen of England was the ultimate sign, that he, Trump, had made it in life,"" wrote his former Russia adviser Fiona Hill in her White House memoir. For Trump, getting close to a King or Queen seems to have been the ultimate way for an outsider to become an insider. Offering him a second state visit has been called ""unprecedented"". And it is very rare, although Queen Margrethe and Prince Henrik of Denmark also had two, in 1974 and 2000. Since the start of Queen Elizabeth II's reign in 1952, there have only been three state visits by US presidents - George W Bush, Barack Obama and Trump - who is the only one who has had two. There have been other presidential trips to the UK, but not fully-fledged state visits. The significance of that shouldn't be underestimated and it reflects how much Trump dominates the international news agenda. For the UK government, his apparent fandom for the royals creates an opportunity to make its own pitch to Trump. Getty Images The King and PM Mark Carney asserted Canada's independence from US claims","Former US President Donald Trump is scheduled for a state visit to the UK, his first since leaving office, arriving Monday for a meticulously planned royal welcome. The UK government aims to deploy a ""spectacular royal charm offensive,"" led by King Charles III and the Royal Family, to ""dazzle and flatter"" Trump with extensive pomp, pageantry, lavish banquets, and ceremonial events.

This ""carefully crafted"" visit is intended as a diplomatic ""ace card,"" leveraging Trump's known admiration for the monarchy – a sentiment reportedly influenced by his mother's fascination with Queen Elizabeth II – to influence him on ""awkward issues"" such as Ukraine and create a positive ""feelgood factor."" Experts highlight that Trump views encounters with royalty as the ultimate sign of having ""made it in life.""

Despite King Charles's personal views on issues like the environment and democracy, which differ significantly from Trump's, he is expected to adhere scrupulously to the government's diplomatic script. The visit will feature a packed schedule of royal spectacles, primarily within the Windsor estate, with security concerns and anticipated protests leading to closed events, helicopter transfers, and no public processions.

This ""unprecedented"" second state visit for Trump underscores his continued international profile. The Royal Family, including Prince William, Catherine, Princess of Wales, and Queen Camilla, will play key roles in hospitality, with Trump also slated to pay respects at Queen Elizabeth II's tomb. While King Charles and Trump share a decades-long history and their families have intersected, Prince Andrew, previously a ""secret weapon,"" will be ""airbrushed out"" of the proceedings. The UK government hopes this ""royal schmooze-fest"" will make a lasting positive impression, utilizing Trump's personal connection to royalty for strategic diplomatic gain.","**ब्रेकिंग न्यूज़: ट्रंप की ब्रिटेन यात्रा, शाही परिवार का ""चकाचौंध भरा अभियान"" यूक्रेन जैसे ""अटपटे"" मुद्दों पर प्रभाव डालने की उम्मीद**

इस ""सावधानीपूर्वक तैयार की गई"" यात्रा को एक कूटनीतिक ""तुरूप का इक्का"" माना जा रहा है। इसका उद्देश्य राजशाही के प्रति ट्रंप की ज्ञात प्रशंसा का लाभ उठाना है – एक भावना जो कथित तौर पर उनकी मां के महारानी एलिजाबेथ द्वितीय के प्रति आकर्षण से प्रभावित थी – ताकि उन्हें यूक्रेन जैसे ""संवेदनशील मुद्दों"" पर प्रभावित किया जा सके और एक सकारात्मक ""सकारात्मक माहौल"" बनाया जा सके। विशेषज्ञ इस बात पर ज़ोर देते हैं कि ट्रंप शाही परिवार के साथ मुलाकातों को ""जीवन में सफल होने"" के अंतिम प्रतीक के रूप में देखते हैं।

किंग चार्ल्स के पर्यावरण और लोकतंत्र जैसे मुद्दों पर व्यक्तिगत विचार, जो ट्रंप के विचारों से काफी भिन्न हैं, इसके बावजूद उनसे उम्मीद की जाती है कि वह सरकार की कूटनीतिक पटकथा का पूरी सावधानी से पालन करेंगे। इस यात्रा में शाही भव्य आयोजनों का एक व्यस्त कार्यक्रम होगा, जो मुख्य रूप से विंडसर एस्टेट के भीतर आयोजित किया जाएगा। सुरक्षा चिंताओं और अपेक्षित विरोध प्रदर्शनों के कारण सभी कार्यक्रम बंद रहेंगे, आवाजाही हेलीकॉप्टर से होगी और कोई सार्वजनिक जुलूस नहीं निकाला जाएगा।

ट्रंप के लिए यह ""अभूतपूर्व"" दूसरी राजकीय यात्रा उनके निरंतर अंतरराष्ट्रीय कद को रेखांकित करती है। शाही परिवार, जिसमें प्रिंस विलियम, वेल्स की राजकुमारी कैथरीन और क्वीन कैमिला शामिल हैं, मेहमाननवाज़ी में महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाएंगे। ट्रंप महारानी एलिजाबेथ द्वितीय की कब्र पर भी श्रद्धांजलि अर्पित करेंगे। किंग चार्ल्स और ट्रंप का दशकों पुराना संबंध है और उनके परिवार एक-दूसरे से जुड़े रहे हैं, लेकिन प्रिंस एंड्रयू, जो पहले एक ""गुप्त हथियार"" माने जाते थे, को इन आयोजनों से ""दूर रखा जाएगा""। ब्रिटेन सरकार को उम्मीद है कि यह ""शाही मेल-जोल का उत्सव"" एक स्थायी सकारात्मक छाप छोड़ेगा, जिसका उपयोग रणनीतिक कूटनीतिक लाभ के लिए राजशाही के साथ ट्रंप के व्यक्तिगत संबंध का लाभ उठाने हेतु किया जाएगा।",en,[],,"If anyone can get the president's attention, King Charles and the Royal Family must be close to the top of the list.",[''],www.bbc.com/news/us-canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major Tennessee hub is the next target in Trump's ongoing crackdown on crime in Democrat-led cities. Speaking to CNN on Saturday, Young said he is ""not happy"" with the decision. The deployment to Memphis would mark an escalation in Trump's use of troops and comes roughly a month after he sent the National Guard to the streets of Washington DC. The US president made the Memphis announcement during a wide-ranging interview on Fox News on Friday, and claimed that Young, a Democrat, was ""happy"" about the decision, as was the state's governor, who is a Republican. However, Young told CNN that he doesn't want the National Guard in Memphis. The deployment of federal troops was discussed during the week, Young said. But the Memphis mayor said it was never confirmed directly by the governor or the president - until the Fox News interview. ""That was the confirmation,"" he said. Memphis has one of the highest rates of crime in the US, with 2,501 violent crimes per 100,000 people, FBI data shows. ""We're going to Memphis,"" Trump said, without giving details of when troops would arrive. ""Memphis is deeply troubled."" He added that he also wanted to lower crime in New Orleans, Baltimore and Chicago. The country has been wondering for weeks if he would deploy troops to Chicago, as his immigration enforcement ""Operation Midway Blitz"" ramps up.

Young told CNN that despite discussions, the deployment was never directly confirmed to him by the governor or the president before Trump's public announcement on Friday. Trump had claimed Young was ""happy"" about the plan, a sentiment the mayor explicitly denied, adding he does not want federal troops in the city.

हालांकि, मेम्फिस के मेयर पॉल यंग ने इस फैसले का कड़ा विरोध किया है। उन्होंने कहा कि वह इस तैनाती और जिस तरीके से इसकी घोषणा की गई, उससे 'खुश नहीं' हैं।

यंग ने सीएनएन को बताया कि चर्चाओं के बावजूद, शुक्रवार को ट्रंप की सार्वजनिक घोषणा से पहले, राज्यपाल या राष्ट्रपति द्वारा उन्हें इस तैनाती की सीधे तौर पर कभी पुष्टि नहीं की गई थी। ट्रंप ने दावा किया था कि यंग इस योजना से 'खुश' थे, लेकिन मेयर ने इस बात को स्पष्ट रूप से नकार दिया। उन्होंने आगे कहा कि वह शहर में संघीय सैनिकों को नहीं चाहते।

यह कदम ट्रंप द्वारा संघीय सैनिकों के उपयोग में वृद्धि को दर्शाता है, खासकर वाशिंगटन डी.सी. में इसी तरह की तैनाती के बाद। ट्रंप ने न्यू ऑरलियन्स, बाल्टीमोर और शिकागो में भी अपराध कम करने की इच्छा का उल्लेख किया, यह बताते हुए कि उन्होंने शुरू में शिकागो में सैनिकों को भेजना पसंद किया था।",en,[],,The deployment of the National Guard to Memphis comes roughly a month after he sent troops to Washington DC.,[''],www.bbc.com/news/us-canada,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

President Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that US forces destroyed a vessel which he said had departed from Venezuela. He said the boat was operated by the Tren de Aragua cartel and was carrying drugs bound for the US. US defence officials have so far declined to offer details on the strike, footage of which Trump shared on Truth Social, including what legal authority they relied upon to justify it. BBC Verify reached out to a range of experts in international and maritime law, with several saying that US may have acted illegally in attacking the vessel. The US is not a signatory to United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, but the US military's legal advisors have previously said that the US should ""act in a manner consistent with its provisions"". Under the convention, countries agree not to interfere with vessels operating in international waters. There are limited exceptions to this which allow a state to seize a ship, such as a ""hot pursuit"" where a vessel is chased from a country's waters into the high seas. ""Force can be used to stop a boat but generally this should be non-lethal measures,"" Prof Luke Moffett of Queens University Belfast said. But he added that the use of aggressive tactics must be ""reasonable and necessary in self-defence where there is immediate threat of serious injury or loss of life to enforcement officials"", noting that the US moves were likely ""unlawful under the law of the sea"". Are US strikes on alleged cartel members legal? Experts have also questioned whether the killing of the alleged members of the Tren de Aragua cartel could contravene international law on the use of force. Under Article 2(4) of the UN charter, countries can resort to force when under attack and deploying their military in self-defence. Trump has previously accused the Tren de Aragua cartel of conducting irregular warfare against the US, and the state department has designated the group as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation. But Prof Michael Becker of Trinity College Dublin told BBC Verify that the US actions ""stretches the meaning of the term beyond its breaking point"". ""The fact that US officials describe the individuals killed by the US strike as narco-terrorists does not transform them into lawful military targets,"" he said. ""The US is not engaged in an armed conflict with Venezuela or the Tren de Aragua criminal organization."" ""Not only does the strike appear to have violated the prohibition on the use of force, it also runs afoul of the right to life under international human rights law."" Prof Moffett said that the use of force in this case could amount to an ""extrajudicial arbitrary killing"" and ""a fundamental violation of human rights"". ""Labelling everyone a terrorist does not make them a lawful target and enables states to side-step international law,"" he said. Donald Trump/Truth Social Donald Trump posted a video on social media which he said showed the moment of the strike Notre Dame Law School Professor Mary Ellen O'Connell told BBC Verify that the strike ""violated fundamental principles of international law"", adding: ""Intentional killing outside armed conflict hostilities is unlawful unless it is to save a life immediately."" ""Sometimes armed groups waging war against governments deal in drugs to pay for their participation in conflict. There is no evidence the gang President Trump targeted is such a group."" But US officials have been quick to defend the strike. Republican Senator Lindsay Graham wrote on X that the strike was the ""ultimate - and most welcome - sign that we have a new sheriff in town"". Getty Images Republican Senator Lindsay Graham has defended the strikes His fellow Republican senator, Bernie Moreno from Ohio, wrote: ""Sinking this boat saved American lives. To the narco traffickers and the narco dictators, you'll eventually get the same treatment."" A White House official told BBC Verify that Trump had authorised the strike on the boat, which they said was crewed by Tren de Aragua members, after it left Venezuela. The official added that the president was committed to using all means to prevent drugs reaching the US. The Pentagon has declined to share the legal advice it obtained before carrying out the strike. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News: ""we've got incredible assets and they are gathering in the region... those 11 drug traffickers are no longer with us, sending a very clear signal that this is an activity the United States is not going to tolerate in our hemisphere."" Can Trump launch attacks without Congressional approval? Questions have also been raised as to whether the White House complied with US law in authorising the strike. The US constitution says that only Congress has the power to declare war. However, Article II - which lays out the president's powers - says that ""the president shall be Commander in Chief of the Army"" and some constitutional experts have suggested that this grants the president the power to authorise strikes against military targets. Trump administration sources have previously cited this provision when defending US strikes on Iran. But it is unclear whether that provision extends to the use of force against non-state actors such as drug cartels. Trump says 11 killed in US strike on drug-carrying vessel from Venezuela US offers $50m reward for arrest of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro Venezuela's ex-spy chief pleads guilty to narco-terrorism charges Rumen Cholakov, an expert in US constiutional law at King's College London told BBC Verify that since 9/11, US presidents have relied on the 2001 Authorization of Use of Military Force Act (AUMF) when carrying out strikes against groups responsible for the attacks. ""Its scope has been expanded consistently in subsequent administrations,"" he added. ""It is not immediately obvious that drug cartels such as Tren de Aragua would be within the President's AUMF powers, but that might be what ""narco-terrorists"" is hinting at."" Questions also remain as to whether Trump complied with the War Powers Resolution, which demands that the president ""in every possible instance shall consult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces into hostilities"". How did the US conduct the strike?","The United States conducted an unprecedented strike in the Caribbean Sea, destroying a vessel allegedly linked to Venezuela and operated by the Tren de Aragua cartel, which President Donald Trump claimed was transporting drugs to the US. The White House reported 11 drug traffickers were killed in the operation.

The legality of this strike has drawn significant international and domestic scrutiny. Legal experts widely suggest it may have violated international human rights and maritime law, including the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the UN Charter's restrictions on the use of force. Critics, such as Prof. Luke Moffett and Prof. Michael Becker, argue that labeling individuals as ""narco-terrorists"" does not transform them into lawful military targets or justify lethal force outside an armed conflict, potentially constituting an ""extrajudicial arbitrary killing."" The US is not considered to be in an armed conflict with Venezuela or the Tren de Aragua.

Domestically, questions persist regarding whether the strike complied with US law, specifically concerning presidential authority to launch such attacks without Congressional approval under the War Powers Resolution or the scope of the 2001 Authorization of Use of Military Force (AUMF) to target non-state actors like drug cartels. The Pentagon has declined to offer details or share its legal advice.

Despite the legal controversy, US officials and some Republican senators, including Lindsay Graham and Bernie Moreno, have defended the strike as being in national security interests, preventing drug flows, and sending a strong signal to traffickers. A White House official stated Trump authorized the strike to prevent drugs from reaching the US.","संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका ने कैरिबियन सागर में एक अभूतपूर्व कार्रवाई की, जिसमें कथित तौर पर वेनेजुएला से जुड़े और 'ट्रेन डे अरागुआ' गिरोह (कार्टेल) द्वारा चलाए जा रहे एक पोत को नष्ट कर दिया गया। राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप ने दावा किया कि यह पोत अमेरिका में नशीले पदार्थ ले जा रहा था। व्हाइट हाउस ने बताया कि इस अभियान में 11 मादक पदार्थ तस्कर मारे गए।

इस हमले की वैधता ने अंतरराष्ट्रीय और घरेलू स्तर पर महत्वपूर्ण सवालों को जन्म दिया है। कानूनी विशेषज्ञों का व्यापक रूप से मानना है कि इसने अंतरराष्ट्रीय मानवाधिकार और समुद्री कानून का उल्लंघन किया हो सकता है, जिसमें संयुक्त राष्ट्र समुद्री कानून संधि (UNCLOS) और संयुक्त राष्ट्र चार्टर के बल प्रयोग पर लगे प्रतिबंध शामिल हैं। प्रो. ल्यूक मोफेट और प्रो. माइकल बेकर जैसे आलोचकों का तर्क है कि व्यक्तियों को 'नार्को-आतंकवादी' करार देने से वे वैध सैन्य लक्ष्य में नहीं बदल जाते हैं, न ही सशस्त्र संघर्ष के बाहर घातक बल प्रयोग को उचित ठहराया जा सकता है। उनका कहना है कि यह संभावित रूप से एक 'गैर-न्यायिक मनमानी हत्या' है। अमेरिका को वेनेजुएला या 'ट्रेन डे अरागुआ' के साथ सशस्त्र संघर्ष में नहीं माना जाता है।

घरेलू स्तर पर, यह सवाल बना हुआ है कि क्या यह हमला अमेरिकी कानून के अनुरूप था। विशेष रूप से, युद्ध शक्ति प्रस्ताव (War Powers Resolution) के तहत कांग्रेस की मंजूरी के बिना ऐसे हमलों को शुरू करने के राष्ट्रपति के अधिकार, या 'ट्रेन डे अरागुआ' जैसे गैर-राज्यीय तत्वों/मादक पदार्थ गिरोहों को निशाना बनाने के लिए 2001 के सैन्य बल प्रयोग प्राधिकरण (AUMF) के दायरे पर सवाल उठ रहे हैं। पेंटागन ने इस पर कोई विवरण देने या अपनी कानूनी सलाह साझा करने से इनकार कर दिया है।

कानूनी विवाद के बावजूद, अमेरिकी अधिकारियों और लिंडसे ग्राहम तथा बर्नी मोरेनो सहित कुछ रिपब्लिकन सीनेटरों ने इस हमले का बचाव करते हुए कहा है कि यह राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा के हितों में था, नशीले पदार्थों के प्रवाह को रोकने और तस्करों को एक कड़ा संदेश देने के लिए आवश्यक था। व्हाइट हाउस के एक अधिकारी ने बताया कि ट्रंप ने इस हमले को इसलिए अधिकृत किया था ताकि नशीले पदार्थ अमेरिका तक न पहुंच सकें।",en,[],,Experts suggest the strike - which killed 11 alleged cartel members - may be illegal under international law.,[''],www.bbc.com/news/world/latin_america,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Images of Bolsonaro doubled over in pain, wearing a T-shirt in Brazil's football colours, were shared millions of times and broadcast endlessly on television. The former army captain survived, and the shock and commotion caused by the attack boosted his outsider image and helped carry him to victory weeks later. Seven years on, Brazil's Supreme Court has found him guilty of plotting a coup and sentenced him to more than 27 years in prison. On the face of it, Bolsonaro's career is over. However, he remains one of the most consequential politicians of recent decades, and with allies already pushing for amnesty, his influence and even the prospect of a comeback still hangs over Brazil's future. The long road to power Getty Images Jair Bolsonaro spent three decades as an obscure congressman Because of his inflammatory rhetoric, Bolsonaro was never taken seriously by most of Brazil's political establishment before becoming president. In July 2018, three months before the election, I was BBC Brasil's São Paulo bureau chief. In conversations with pollsters, politicians and business leaders, the consensus was clear: despite leading in most polls, Bolsonaro could not win; he lacked the machinery of a major party and his support would quickly fade once television campaigning began. Bolsonaro was a former army official, who left the forces after campaigning for higher military pay and being accused - then acquitted - of plotting a bombing as part of salary protests in the 1980s. He then began a three-decade career as a congressman, building a persona on incendiary statements and defence of the military dictatorship that ended in 1985. What was Bolsonaro convicted of and what happens next? For decades, he was a constant presence on television talk shows where he railed against democracy and praised authoritarian rule. In a 1999 interview, he said that as president, he would stage a coup on his first day and ""finish the work"" of the dictatorship by killing 30,000 people. The first, he said, would be the then-president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso. All through his seven terms in Congress, Bolsonaro remained on the fringes of Brazil's political establishment - an outsider. But in 2018, Brazilians were hungry for just that. The country had endured five years of turmoil: mass protests in 2013, a deep recession, the impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in 2016, and the sweeping ""Car Wash"" investigation. That probe implicated politicians across the political spectrum, but hit hardest the Workers' Party (PT) of Rousseff and Lula, who had governed Brazil from 2003 to 2010. In April 2018, Lula - the immensely popular former president who had left office with approval ratings above 80% - was jailed on corruption charges later annulled by the Supreme Court. To many Brazilians, every politician seemed compromised. Bolsonaro saw his opportunity. Mostly through social media, he managed to gather a broad coalition; the middle and lower-middle classes frustrated with the PT and the sense of widespread corruption; a conservative evangelical community that already represented more than 26% of the population; elements of the police and military; far-right militants; business sectors dissatisfied with the economy; and - probably most important - millions of ordinary Brazilians who simply believed it was time for a change. In October 2018, that coalition turned out in force to vote him into power. His presidency looked nothing like any Brazilian government since the country's return to democracy in the 1980s. An outsider who changed everything Getty Images Supporters of Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro have held rallies to show their backing Bolsonaro managed to turn the Brazilian right into a mass movement for the first time in history. Yet translating that into a government was another story. He assembled a cabinet with little experience in federal administration and leaned heavily on military officers to fill key posts. His administration was pro-business, and aligned itself diplomatically with Donald Trump's United States - who Bolsonaro hailed as an inspiration - and with other conservative governments in Hungary and Israel. He weakened oversight and relaxed protections on the environment that favoured agribusiness. The result was a surge in deforestation in the Amazon and other areas - sparking international anger. But the real challenges came with the pandemic in 2020. From the beginning, Bolsonaro opposed social distancing, arguing it would damage the economy. On several occasions, he joined mass demonstrations where advice to wear masks and distance was openly defied. In March 2020, he compared Covid-19 to a ""little flu"". And in the following month, when asked about the mounting death toll, he replied simply: ""I'm not a gravedigger"" - a remark he later admitted regretting. Bolsonaro was also a vaccine sceptic, resisting offers to buy jabs for his population and refusing to get one himself. In defiance of his own health officials, he promoted unproven treatments such as hydroxychloroquine. Eventually, vaccines became available. But many specialists believe that thousands of lives could have been saved if the government had adopted social distancing measures and immunised earlier. In total, more than 700,000 Brazilians died of Covid-19 between 2020 and March 2023. The president's nemesis Getty Images Alexandre de Moraes was one of the five Supreme Court justices tasked with delivering a verdict in the trial More than any opposition party, Bolsonaro's most formidable foe during his presidency was the Supreme Court, which struck down his attempts to block social distancing and mask use during the pandemic, and also rejected policies that would have made it easier for Brazilians to acquire firearms. One judge became his nemesis: Alexandre de Moraes. A career public prosecutor and law professor, he had served in conservative administrations in São Paulo before being appointed to the court by centre-right President Michel Temer, who succeeded Rousseff. In 2020, Moraes was appointed to lead an inquiry into the spread of disinformation on social media that targeted his court. That later branched into other cases, including one focused on threats against democracy by Bolsonaro supporters. All were kept under Moraes's supervision. Such a concentration of power became a point of criticism, not only from Bolsonaro loyalists but also from some lawyers and centrist politicians. Moraes's role, however, was grounded in law and most of his decisions were later upheld by the rest of the Supreme Court. For some analysts and commentators, entrusting him with this task was seen as the only way to safeguard Brazil's democracy. However, Bolsonaro's dissatisfaction only grew, and on many occasions he declared that he would not comply with the court's rulings. At mass demonstrations in Brasília and São Paulo in September 2021, he escalated his attacks, calling Moraes a canalha (scoundrel) and declaring that he would only leave the presidency ""arrested, dead, or victorious"", adding that he ""wanted to tell the traitors that I will never be arrested"". The speech was widely seen as a direct threat to Brazil's democratic institutions. Conspiracy and election controversy Getty Images In 2021, Lula - who had left jail in November 2019 and had all charges against him annulled by the Supreme Court - was cleared to run in the October 2022 election, setting up a head-to-head with the incumbent. Bolsonaro and his allies began an intense campaign alleging - without evidence - that the country's electronic voting machines could be hacked. Bolsonaro claimed that Lula could only win against him through fraud. The campaign was widely seen as an effort to lay the groundwork to contest any result that went against him. Bolsonaro insisted on paper ballots only for the election, and suggested he would reject any result without them. Electoral authorities rejected the proposal. There were further controversies during voting. On the day of the run-off between Bolsonaro and Lula, the federal road police - under Bolsonaro's government - set up roadblocks in areas where Lula had strong support. The government claimed it was to prevent fraud, but it was widely seen as an attempt to stop Lula's supporters from reaching the polls. It was Moraes, the Supreme Court justice, who ordered the roadblocks lifted and threatened to jail the police chief if they continued. In the end, as most polls had predicted, Lula won - but by a very slight margin of less than two percentage points. Obstinance turns to violence Getty Images A pro-Bolsonaro demonstration in Sao Paulo in 2023 In the aftermath of the election, Bolsonaro remained silent and out of public view. When he finally spoke, it was only briefly. He did not acknowledge defeat - something that he would never do - but authorised the start of the transition. At the same time, instigated by the president, his supporters were using lorries to block roads across Brazil, while hundreds of Bolsonaro loyalists camped outside army barracks demanding that the election be annulled and the armed forces intervene to prevent Lula's inauguration. Later investigations showed that, during this period, Bolsonaro met military leaders to discuss imposing a state of emergency to overturn the election. The plan did not proceed because two of the three military chiefs refused to take part, according to statements they gave under oath. Police later discovered that a plan to assassinate Lula and Moraes had been printed by one of the president's aides inside the presidential palace. Bolsonaro denies any knowledge about the plans and argues that he only discussed Constitutional measures with military chiefs – although Brazilian law does not allow for a state of emergency to be declared in order to annul an election. In the final days of 2022, while still president, Bolsonaro flew to Florida and did not return to attend Lula's inauguration on 1 January, 2023 - breaking a tradition in which the outgoing president hands the presidential sash to his successor. On 8 January, Brazil witnessed something unprecedented: thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the presidential palace in Brasília, in what looked like a tropical version of the US Capitol attack. Lula was not at the palace, and security forces brought the riot under control by the end of the day. Bolsonaro, still in the US, denied involvement - although a majority of Supreme Court justices later saw the assault as part of a broader plan to remove Lula. The end of the line... for now Getty Images","Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's former president, has been sentenced to over 27 years in prison by the Supreme Court for plotting a coup, marking a dramatic legal and political downfall. His unconventional rise began with decades as an obscure, inflammatory congressman. In 2018, a stabbing during his presidential campaign garnered immense sympathy, boosting his ""outsider"" image amidst widespread public frustration with political corruption, ultimately propelling him to victory.

Bolsonaro's presidency, a stark departure from previous administrations, was characterized by a pro-business agenda, diplomatic alignment with Donald Trump, and a weakening of environmental protections that led to increased Amazon deforestation. His administration faced its most severe challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic, which Bolsonaro notoriously downplayed as a ""little flu,"" resisted social distancing measures, promoted unproven treatments, and expressed vaccine skepticism, contributing to over 700,000 deaths.

A formidable opponent throughout his term was the Supreme Court, particularly Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who actively countered Bolsonaro's attempts to undermine democratic institutions and electoral processes. Leading up to the 2022 election, Bolsonaro made unsubstantiated claims of widespread voting fraud, sought to discredit the electronic voting system, and called for paper ballots. He ultimately lost narrowly to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

Following his defeat, Bolsonaro refused to concede, instead instigating widespread protests by his supporters, who blocked roads and camped outside army barracks demanding the election be annulled. He reportedly met with military leaders to discuss overturning the election, a plan that failed due to key military chiefs' refusal to participate. Bolsonaro then flew to Florida, not attending Lula's inauguration. This period culminated in the unprecedented January 8, 2023, storming of government buildings in Brasília by his loyalists, an act the Supreme Court largely viewed as part of a broader coup attempt.

While his political career appears over with this conviction, Bolsonaro remains a consequential figure in Brazilian politics. With allies already advocating for amnesty, his influence and the prospect of a future comeback continue to loom over the nation's political landscape.","यहाँ उस अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

**जायर बोल्सोनारो को तख्तापलट की साजिश रचने के आरोप में 27 साल से अधिक की जेल की सजा**

ब्राजील के पूर्व राष्ट्रपति जायर बोल्सोनारो को सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने तख्तापलट की साजिश रचने के आरोप में 27 साल से अधिक की जेल की सजा सुनाई है, जो उनके कानूनी और राजनीतिक जीवन में एक नाटकीय पतन का प्रतीक है। उनका गैर-पारंपरिक राजनीतिक उदय दशकों तक एक गुमनाम और भड़काऊ सांसद के रूप में रहा। 2018 में, उनके राष्ट्रपति अभियान के दौरान हुए एक चाकू हमले ने भारी सहानुभूति बटोरी, जिससे राजनीतिक भ्रष्टाचार से व्यापक सार्वजनिक निराशा के बीच उनकी ""बाहरी"" (आउटसाइडर) छवि को बढ़ावा मिला और अंततः उन्हें जीत मिली।

बोल्सोनारो का राष्ट्रपति काल, जो पिछली सरकारों से बिल्कुल अलग था, एक व्यापार-समर्थक एजेंडे, डोनाल्ड ट्रंप के साथ राजनयिक तालमेल और पर्यावरण संरक्षणों को कमजोर करने के लिए जाना जाता था, जिसके परिणामस्वरूप अमेज़न वनों की कटाई में वृद्धि हुई। उनके प्रशासन को COVID-19 महामारी के दौरान अपनी सबसे गंभीर चुनौती का सामना करना पड़ा, जिसे बोल्सोनारो ने जानबूझकर ""थोड़ा फ्लू"" कहकर कम करके आंका, सामाजिक दूरी के उपायों का विरोध किया, अप्रमाणित उपचारों को बढ़ावा दिया और वैक्सीन को लेकर संदेह व्यक्त किया, जिससे 700,000 से अधिक मौतों में योगदान हुआ।

उनके पूरे कार्यकाल के दौरान सुप्रीम कोर्ट एक दुर्जेय प्रतिद्वंद्वी बनी रही, विशेष रूप से न्यायमूर्ति एलेक्जेंडर डी मोरास, जिन्होंने लोकतांत्रिक संस्थानों और चुनावी प्रक्रियाओं को कमजोर करने के बोल्सोनारो के प्रयासों का सक्रिय रूप से मुकाबला किया। 2022 के चुनाव से पहले, बोल्सोनारो ने बड़े पैमाने पर मतदान में धांधली के अप्रमाणित दावे किए, इलेक्ट्रॉनिक वोटिंग प्रणाली को बदनाम करने की कोशिश की और कागजी मतपत्रों की मांग की। वह अंततः लुइज़ इनासियो लूला डा सिल्वा से बहुत कम अंतर से हार गए।

अपनी हार के बाद, बोल्सोनारो ने हार मानने से इनकार कर दिया, और इसके बजाय अपने समर्थकों द्वारा व्यापक विरोध प्रदर्शनों को उकसाया, जिन्होंने सड़कें अवरुद्ध कीं और चुनाव रद्द करने की मांग करते हुए सेना बैरकों के बाहर डेरा डाला। कथित तौर पर उन्होंने चुनाव पलटने पर चर्चा करने के लिए सैन्य नेताओं से मुलाकात की, लेकिन प्रमुख सैन्य प्रमुखों के इसमें भाग लेने से इनकार करने के कारण यह योजना विफल हो गई। इसके बाद बोल्सोनारो फ्लोरिडा चले गए और लूला के शपथ ग्रहण समारोह में शामिल नहीं हुए। यह अवधि 8 जनवरी, 2023 को ब्रासीलिया में उनके वफादारों द्वारा सरकारी इमारतों पर किए गए अभूतपूर्व हमले के साथ समाप्त हुई, जिसे सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने बड़े पैमाने पर एक व्यापक तख्तापलट के प्रयास का हिस्सा माना।

हालांकि इस दोषसिद्धि के साथ उनका राजनीतिक करियर समाप्त होता दिख रहा है, बोल्सोनारो ब्राजील की राजनीति में एक महत्वपूर्ण व्यक्ति बने हुए हैं। उनके सहयोगी पहले से ही माफी की वकालत कर रहे हैं, ऐसे में उनका प्रभाव और भविष्य में वापसी की संभावना देश के राजनीतिक परिदृश्य पर अभी भी मंडरा रही है।",en,[],,"The Brazilian ex-president has been sentenced to 27 years for plotting a coup, but an amnesty could be on the cards.",[''],www.bbc.com/news/world/latin_america,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The company, which also owns Facebook and WhatsApp, did not immediately react to the ruling. The 45-year-old, whose account had more than five million followers, is one of Colombia's best known adult content actresses. The South American nation's Constitutional Court said on Friday that the tech firm had removed Esperanza Gómez's account ""without a clear and transparent justification"" and without offering similar treatment to other, similar accounts. Colombia's highest court has ruled that Meta violated a porn star's right to freedom of expression when it deleted her Instagram account. Ms Gómez had alleged that the decision to close her account had affected her ability to work and had been influenced by her pornographic work beyond the platform. She also claimed Meta had not followed due process. In its ruling, the court said that, while it recognised the social media platform's need to moderate content, this did not justify closing a porn star's account ""without a clear and transparent justification"". It also found Meta ""applied its policies on nudity and sexual services inconsistently"", with other accounts with similar content remaining active. The court said social media posts were protected under Colombia's constitution and should only be limited in a proportionate way where necessary. It ordered Meta to ""review and adjust Instagram's terms of use and privacy policy so that users are clearly aware of the mechanisms for challenging moderation decisions"" and ""more precisely define"" its rules on implicit sexual content. If social media platforms use offline activities as a criterion for content moderation, they must clearly state these, the court said. The court did not specify sanctions for non-compliance, nor whether Ms Gómez would receive any redress. The BBC has contacted Meta for comment. It is not the first time that a South American court has required a social network to change its policies. Brazil's Supreme Court recent ruled that social media were directly liable for illegal content, including hate speech, and must immediately act to remove it and accounts proliferating it. That ruling followed a judge ordering the suspension of dozens of X accounts for allegedly spreading disinformation. It led to the social media platform briefly being banned in Brazil, before it began complying with the ruling and paid a $5.1 (£3.8m) fine.","Colombia's Constitutional Court has ruled that Meta violated the right to freedom of expression of adult content actress Esperanza Gómez by deleting her Instagram account. The court found that Meta removed Gómez's account ""without a clear and transparent justification"" and applied its policies on nudity and sexual services ""inconsistently,"" as other accounts with similar content remained active.

Gómez had successfully argued that the removal affected her ability to work and that Meta had not followed due process. The court emphasized that while content moderation is necessary, it does not justify closing an account without proper cause, as social media posts are protected under Colombia's constitution and can only be limited proportionately.

Meta has been ordered to review and adjust Instagram's terms of use and privacy policy, specifically to ""more precisely define"" its rules on implicit sexual content. Crucially, the court mandated that if social media platforms use offline activities as a criterion for content moderation, they must clearly state these.

This ruling underscores a growing trend in South America, where courts are increasingly challenging social media policies. Brazil's Supreme Court, for instance, recently held social media platforms directly liable for illegal content, including hate speech, leading to the temporary suspension and fining of platforms like X for non-compliance. Meta has not yet reacted to the Colombian ruling, and no specific sanctions for non-compliance were immediately specified.","यहाँ अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

She was honorary president and a founding member of the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo, a group that searched for children stolen during Argentina's military dictatorship between 1976 and 1983. ""We only have words of gratitude for her dedication... and the love with which she searched for the grandsons and granddaughters until the very end,"" the campaign group said in a statement. Some 30,000 people were killed or forcibly disappeared during Argentina's ""Dirty War"". Children of detained opposition activists were seized and given up for adoption. Rosa Roisinblit was born in 1919 in Moises Ville, a town of Jewish immigrants in central Argentina. She worked as an obstetrician and moved to Buenos Aires in 1949, where she married in 1951. Getty Images Rosa Roisinblit (left) with Estela de Carlotto, co-founder of the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo, in 1987 After the military coup of March 1976, the junta moved to eradicate the opposition. Tens of thousands of activists were snatched in raids and held in clandestine detention and torture centres. Many were thrown into the sea on notorious ""death flights"". An estimated 500 of their babies were stolen. Roisinblit's pregnant daughter Patricia, son-in-law José Pérez Rojo and 15-month old granddaughter Mariana, were kidnapped in 1978. The couple had been left-wing activists. The family was transferred to a school, known as Esma, which was the largest detention centre in Buenos Aires. Patricia Roisinblit was kept alive long enough to give birth to her son in a basement. The couple's bodies were never found, and Mariana was returned to Rosa, who raised her. The new-born baby was given to an air-force intelligence officer to bring up.

After her family's abduction, Roisinblit joined the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo and served as treasurer for six years before working as vice-president from 1989 to 2022. Her grandson was tracked down in 2000 by his sister Mariana and through the work of the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo. He was reunited with Rosa and Mariana after DNA tests confirmed they were related. He had been given the name Guillermo Francisco Gómez by the adoptive parents: Francisco Gómez and Teodora Jofre. Roisinblit was in the courtroom in 2016, when Goméz was jailed for life over the boy's abduction. Jofre was separately jailed for three years. Later that year, two men - a former air force chief an ex-intelligence officer - were sentenced to 25 years for the abduction and torture of Patricia and José. They were among hundreds of soldiers and leaders prosecuted for human-rights abuses. At the age of 96, Roisinblit attended the trial with Guillermo and Mariana. A year later, she told AFP news agency: ""This wound never heals... But to say I'm stopping? No, I'll never stop.""

During this brutal period, an estimated 30,000 people were killed or forcibly disappeared, and children of detained opposition activists were seized and given up for illegal adoption, with around 500 babies stolen. Roisinblit's personal tragedy fueled her activism. In 1978, her pregnant daughter Patricia, son-in-law José Pérez Rojo, and 15-month-old granddaughter Mariana were kidnapped by the junta. Patricia was kept alive long enough to give birth to a son in a clandestine detention centre before she and José vanished forever. Mariana was eventually returned to Rosa, who raised her, but the newborn son was given to an air-force intelligence officer.

After her family's abduction, Roisinblit became a driving force within the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo, serving as a long-time vice-president. Her perseverance led to a profound victory in 2000 when her grandson, raised under the name Guillermo Francisco Gómez, was tracked down by his sister Mariana and reunited with Rosa after DNA confirmation.

Roisinblit continued her fight for justice into her later years, attending the courtroom at age 96 in 2016 to witness Gómez's adoptive father, Francisco Gowmez, jailed for life over the abduction. Later that year, former military officials were also sentenced for the abduction and torture of Patricia and José, part of hundreds of prosecutions for human rights abuses from the era.

Then, Donald Trump announced a deadly strike on a boat he said was carrying drugs. What Washington has planned next is not entirely clear, but some analysts tell the BBC that the risk of escalation in the region is growing by the day. Since the US president's return to office in January, the Trump administration has steadily intensified its anti-drug-trafficking efforts in Latin America. As part of that, the US has seemingly centred on Venezuela - an effort that has led to the mobilisation of military forces from both countries in recent weeks. After Tuesday's bombing of a small vessel in the Caribbean that was allegedly travelling from Venezuela, officials in the US made it clear that military action in the region was not over - hinting at more operations that could target drug trafficking. Venezuela's government has reacted with anger. President Nicolás Maduro denies American accusations that he is involved with drugs trafficking, while another official has questioned the veracity of footage posted by Trump. Trump said the footage showed the killing of 11 ""narcoterrorists"" from the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang, who he said were aboard a small boat. He said the vessel was carrying ""massive amounts of drugs"" and was heading toward the US. In the Oval Office, Trump accused the South American country of being ""very bad, both in terms of drugs and sending some of the worst criminals anywhere in the world into our country"". The move came weeks after the US announced a $50m (£37m) reward for any information leading to the arrest of Maduro - whose election to lead the country has been widely rejected by the international community - on drug-trafficking charges. The analysts who spoke to the BBC suggested that Trump's latest move could have more than one purpose in mind. 'Trump is trying to intimidate the regime' Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News on Wednesday morning that US military activity in the area ""won't stop... with just this strike"". It was a clear attempt to put pressure on Maduro, one commentator said. The prior naval build-up was on a scale not seen in the region since 1965, according to Prof Alan McPherson, who specialises in US-Latin American relations at Temple University. The Pentagon has so far deployed guided missile destroyers, the Iwo Jima amphibious group and a nuclear-powered submarine, along with P-8 intelligence planes and around 4,500 troops to the region. The build-up ""recalls the days of 'gunboat diplomacy' more than a century ago,"" Prof McPherson said. Getty Images Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has regularly clashed with the Trump administration The Pentagon said the deployments aimed to help halt drug trafficking and the actions of criminals, and would aid the US pressure drug networks in the region. But the US Navy might be hoping to strike more directly at Maduro or encourage an internal revolt in the Venezuelan army, Prof McPherson said - though he acknowledged that ""neither of those would require such a flotilla"". ""Whatever the case, clearly, the Trump administration wants to intimidate the [Venezuelan] regime."" Stephen Donehoo, a former US military intelligence official specialising in Latin America, told the BBC that he has ""never seen such a large deployment of naval forces in the [US] Southern Command"" region. Still, it was ""not a force to invade a foreign country,"" Mr Donehoo explained. ""There could be other missions that they have, much more precise,"" such as ""armed drone missions flying over Venezuelan airspace,"" he added. Maduro has rejected US claims he is directly involved in drug trafficking, which he considers a pretence to overthrow his government. He has also said he would mobilise 4.5 million members of the country's militia in response to the US deployment of the war ships. But analysts say Maduro's number is wildly inflated - and that the militia is barely trained and is usually only used to boost numbers at political rallies and parades, so is not a fighting force. Maduro also vowed that Venezuela would immediately ""declare a republic in arms"" if it was attacked. An unusual drugs bust US officials have presented the strike as an effort to halt the flow of drugs to the US - which has been a key mission of Trump's second term. But it was an unusual operation, according to Rebecca Bill Chavez, head of the Inter-American Dialogue think tank in Washington. ""If this [the US movements] is a counter-narcotics deployment, this is unlike any counter-narcotics deployment I've ever seen,"" Ms Chavez, a former US undersecretary of state for the Western Hemisphere, told the BBC. US maritime anti-drug operations are usually led by the Coast Guard, working with regional partners to intercept suspicious vessels. It is unclear whether the US was in contact with other Caribbean officials about Tuesday's strike beforehand. ""The risk of escalation at sea is real,"" Ms Chavez said. The president himself told reporters in the Oval Office that ""you see the bags of drugs all over the boat"", referring to video footage which he said showed the strike. Venezuela is often used as a stop off for transporting cocaine - but the drug is mostly transported to the US via the Pacific Ocean rather than the Caribbean, according to a 2023 UN report. Officials have so far not explained how they determined those on board the boat targeted on Tuesday were members of Tren de Aragua, or what kind of drugs they believe the vessel was transporting. The military strike marked the strongest action the Trump administration has taken against drug trafficking - and is something that legal experts say may have violated international human rights and maritime law. Secretary of State Marco Rubio defended the operation, and indicated the US could take similar action again in the future. ""What will stop them is when you blow [drug traffickers] up,"" he said during a visit to Mexico, lamenting that previous US efforts to stem the trade had not been effective. Getty Images US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has defended the vessel strike 'People are very confused about the real purpose'","On September 4, 2025, the US significantly escalated military pressure on Venezuela, deploying an unprecedented number of warships to the Caribbean and conducting a deadly strike on a vessel it claimed was carrying drugs and ""narcoterrorists."" This comes as the Trump administration, since the President's return to office in January, has intensified anti-drug trafficking efforts focused on Venezuela, with bombings reportedly ongoing since April.

The substantial military deployment, described as the largest in the region since 1965, includes guided missile destroyers, an amphibious group, a nuclear-powered submarine, 4,500 troops, and P-8 intelligence planes. President Trump announced the strike on a boat he said carried ""massive amounts of drugs"" and 11 ""narcoterrorists"" from Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang, later also referencing illegal immigrants. This action followed a $50 million reward offered weeks prior for the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on drug trafficking charges. US officials, including Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, defended the operation, hinting at further strikes and arguing that previous anti-drug efforts were ineffective.

Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro vehemently denied US accusations of drug involvement, calling them a ""pretense to overthrow his government."" He reacted with anger to the attack, vowing to mobilize 4.5 million militia members and declare a ""republic in arms"" if Venezuela is attacked. An official also questioned the veracity of footage posted by Trump.

Analysts suggest Trump's latest moves aim to intimidate the Maduro regime, apply pressure, or bolster the opposition. While the naval buildup is substantial, experts note it is not an invasion force but could be intended for ""more precise"" missions, potentially including armed drone operations. Rebecca Bill Chavez of the Inter-American Dialogue described the strike as ""unusual"" for counter-narcotics operations, typically led by the Coast Guard, and warned of a ""real risk of escalation at sea."" Legal experts have questioned whether the military strike violated international human rights and maritime law, while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has indicated similar actions could be taken in the future.","**वेनेज़ुएला पर अमेरिकी सैन्य दबाव में भारी वृद्धि: ड्रग विरोधी अभियान के तहत घातक हमला और क्षेत्र में सबसे बड़ी तैनाती**

4 सितंबर, 2025 को, अमेरिका ने वेनेज़ुएला पर सैन्य दबाव काफी बढ़ा दिया, कैरिबियन में अभूतपूर्व संख्या में युद्धपोत तैनात किए और एक ऐसे पोत पर जानलेवा हमला किया, जिसके बारे में उसका दावा था कि वह ड्रग्स और ""नारकोटेररिस्ट"" ले जा रहा था। यह ऐसे समय हुआ है जब राष्ट्रपति ट्रम्प के जनवरी में सत्ता में लौटने के बाद से, उनके प्रशासन ने वेनेज़ुएला पर केंद्रित मादक पदार्थ तस्करी विरोधी प्रयासों को तेज कर दिया है, और अप्रैल से कथित तौर पर बमबारी जारी है।

इस महत्वपूर्ण सैन्य तैनाती को 1965 के बाद से क्षेत्र में सबसे बड़ी बताया गया है। इसमें गाइडेड मिसाइल विध्वंसक, एक उभयचर समूह, एक परमाणु-संचालित पनडुब्बी, 4,500 सैनिक और P-8 खुफिया विमान शामिल हैं। राष्ट्रपति ट्रम्प ने एक नाव पर हमले की घोषणा की, जिसके बारे में उन्होंने कहा कि उसमें ""भारी मात्रा में ड्रग्स"" और वेनेज़ुएला के ट्रॅन डी अरागुआ गिरोह के 11 ""नारकोटेररिस्ट"" थे, बाद में उन्होंने अवैध अप्रवासियों का भी जिक्र किया। यह कार्रवाई वेनेज़ुएला के राष्ट्रपति निकोलस मादुरो की मादक पदार्थ तस्करी के आरोपों में गिरफ्तारी के लिए हफ्तों पहले $50 मिलियन का इनाम घोषित किए जाने के बाद हुई। अमेरिकी अधिकारियों, जिनमें रक्षा सचिव पीट हेगसेथ और विदेश मंत्री मार्को रुबियो शामिल थे, ने ऑपरेशन का बचाव किया, और आगे भी हमलों का संकेत देते हुए तर्क दिया कि पहले के मादक पदार्थ विरोधी प्रयास अप्रभावी थे।

वेनेज़ुएला के राष्ट्रपति निकोलस मादुरो ने मादक पदार्थ में शामिल होने के अमेरिकी आरोपों का जोरदार खंडन किया, और उन्हें ""उनकी सरकार को उखाड़ फेंकने का बहाना"" बताया। उन्होंने हमले पर गुस्से में प्रतिक्रिया व्यक्त की, और धमकी दी कि यदि वेनेज़ुएला पर हमला किया जाता है तो 4.5 मिलियन मिलिशिया सदस्यों को लामबंद करेंगे और ""हथियारों से लैस गणराज्य"" की घोषणा करेंगे। एक अधिकारी ने ट्रम्प द्वारा पोस्ट किए गए फुटेज की सत्यता पर भी सवाल उठाया।

विश्लेषकों का सुझाव है कि ट्रम्प के हालिया कदमों का उद्देश्य मादुरो शासन को डराना, दबाव डालना या विपक्ष को मजबूत करना है। हालांकि नौसेना का जमावड़ा काफी है, विशेषज्ञों का कहना है कि यह आक्रमणकारी बल नहीं है, बल्कि इसका उद्देश्य ""अधिक सटीक"" मिशनों के लिए हो सकता है, जिसमें सशस्त्र ड्रोन ऑपरेशन भी शामिल हो सकते हैं। इंटर-अमेरिकन डायलॉग की रेबेका बिल शावेज़ ने इस हमले को मादक पदार्थ विरोधी अभियानों के लिए ""असामान्य"" बताया, जो आमतौर पर कोस्ट गार्ड द्वारा चलाए जाते हैं, और ""समुद्र में तनाव बढ़ने के वास्तविक जोखिम"" की चेतावनी दी। कानूनी विशेषज्ञों ने सवाल उठाया है कि क्या सैन्य हमला अंतरराष्ट्रीय मानवाधिकारों और समुद्री कानून का उल्लंघन करता है, जबकि अमेरिकी विदेश मंत्री मार्को रुबियो ने संकेत दिया है कि भविष्य में भी ऐसी ही कार्रवाई की जा सकती है।",en,[],,"Washington's aims in the region are not entirely clear after fatally striking a drug-carrying vessel earlier this week, analysts say.",[''],www.bbc.com/news/world/latin_america,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A panel of five Supreme Court justices handed down the sentence just hours after they had convicted the former leader. They ruled he was guilty of leading a conspiracy aimed at keeping him in power after he lost the 2022 election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Four of the justices found him guilty while one voted to acquit him. Bolsonaro's lawyers have called the sentence ""absurdly excessive"" and said that they would file ""the appropriate appeals"". The Supreme Court panel also barred him from running for public office until 2060 - eight years after the end of his sentence. Bolsonaro, who was put under house arrest after being deemed a flight risk, did not attend this final phase of the trial in person. But he has in the past said it was designed to prevent him from running in the 2026 presidential election - even though he had already been barred from public office on separate charges. He has also called it a ""witch hunt"". His words have previously been echoed by US President Donald Trump, who imposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, framing them as retaliation for Bolsonaro's prosecution. Reacting to the guilty verdict, Trump said he found it ""very surprising"" and compared it to his own experience: ""That's very much like they tried to do with me. But they didn't get away with it at all."" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Brazil's Supreme Court had ""unjustly ruled to imprison former President Jair Bolsonaro"" and threatened to ""respond accordingly to this witch hunt"". Brazil's foreign ministry reacted swiftly, posting on X that ""threats like the one made today by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in a statement that attacks a Brazilian authority and ignores the facts and the compelling evidence on record, will not intimidate our democracy"". Bolsonaro, who is 70, now faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison. His lawyers are expected to argue that he should be kept under house arrest instead of being sent to jail - as well as plead for a lower sentence. They have also said that they will appeal against his conviction but legal experts have said this may prove difficult, as this is normally only possible if two out of the five justices have voted to acquit. Bolsonaro was found guilty of five charges, all relating to his attempt to cling to power after he was beaten in the 2022 election. But prosecutors said he had started to plot to stay in power long before, proposing a coup to military commanders and sowing unfounded doubts about the electoral system. They also said that Bolsonaro knew of a plan to assassinate Lula and his vice-presidential running mate, as well as a Supreme Court Justice. The justices found he had led a conspiracy and also convicted seven of his co-conspirators, including senior military officers. Among them are two former defence ministers, a former spy chief and former security minster. While the plot failed to enlist enough support from the military to go ahead, it did culminate in the storming of government buildings by Bolsonaro's supporters on 8 January 2023, the justices found. Order was quickly restored and more than 1,500 people were arrested. But, according to Alexandre de Moraes - the justice who oversaw the trial - Brazil had come close to descending into authoritarianism. ""We are slowly forgetting that Brazil almost returned to its 20-year dictatorship because a criminal organisation, comprised of a political group, doesn't know how to lose elections,"" he said before casting his guilty vote. Brazil's recent history and the decades it spent under military rule were also invoked by Justice Cármen Lúcia, who cast the decisive third ""guilty"" vote on Thursday. She compared the attempted coup to a ""virus"", which, if left to fester, can kill the society in which it has taken hold in. The sole dissenting voice on the five-member panel was Luiz Fux, who argued in an 11-hour speech on Wednesday that the accusations against Jair Bolsonaro were unfounded and voted for him to be acquitted. But on Thursday, Cármen Lúcia, the only woman on the panel, insisted that Brazil's democratic order had been at risk and warned that ""there was no immunity to authoritarianism"".","Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been sentenced to 27 years in prison and barred from public office until 2060 by a panel of five Supreme Court justices for orchestrating a conspiracy to remain in power after losing the 2022 election to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

चार न्यायाधीशों ने बोल्सोनारो को सत्ता पर काबिज़ रहने की उनकी कोशिश से संबंधित पांच आरोपों में दोषी पाया। इनमें सैन्य कमांडरों को तख्तापलट का प्रस्ताव देना, चुनावी प्रणाली के बारे में निराधार संदेह फैलाना और लूला की हत्या की योजना से अवगत होना शामिल है। इस साजिश का अंत 8 जनवरी, 2023 को उनके समर्थकों द्वारा सरकारी इमारतों पर धावा बोलने के रूप में हुआ, जिसके परिणामस्वरूप 1,500 से अधिक गिरफ्तारियाँ हुईं। सात सह-साजिशकर्ताओं, जिनमें वरिष्ठ सैन्य अधिकारी और पूर्व मंत्री शामिल थे, को भी दोषी ठहराया गया।

70 वर्षीय बोल्सोनारो, जो मुकदमे के अंतिम चरण के दौरान घर में नजरबंद थे, अब अपना शेष जीवन जेल में बिताने की संभावना का सामना कर रहे हैं। उनके वकीलों ने इस सज़ा को ""बेहद अत्यधिक"" बताया है और अपील दायर करने की योजना बना रहे हैं, हालांकि कानूनी विशेषज्ञों का कहना है कि मजबूत न्यायिक सहमति को देखते हुए यह मुश्किल हो सकता है। बोल्सोनारो ने पहले इस जांच को ""चुड़ैल शिकार"" कहकर खारिज कर दिया था, जिसे उनकी 2026 की राष्ट्रपति पद की उम्मीदवारी को रोकने के लिए डिज़ाइन किया गया था, क्योंकि उन्हें पहले ही अलग-अलग आरोपों में सार्वजनिक पद से प्रतिबंधित किया जा चुका है।

इस फैसले पर कुछ अमेरिकी हस्तियों ने आलोचना की। पूर्व राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प ने इस फैसले को ""बहुत आश्चर्यजनक"" बताया और इसकी तुलना अपनी कानूनी चुनौतियों से की, जबकि अमेरिकी विदेश सचिव मार्को रुबियो ने ""अन्यायपूर्ण"" करार दिए गए इस फैसले पर ""उसी के अनुसार जवाब देने"" की धमकी दी। ब्राजील के विदेश मंत्रालय ने एक्स (पूर्व में ट्विटर) पर तुरंत प्रतिक्रिया देते हुए कहा कि ऐसी ""धमकियाँ... हमारे लोकतंत्र को डरा नहीं पाएंगी।""

न्यायाधीशों ने इस प्रयास की गंभीरता पर जोर दिया। मुकदमे की देखरेख करने वाले न्यायमूर्ति अलेक्जेंड्रे डी मोरेस ने चेतावनी दी कि ब्राजील ""लगभग अपनी 20 साल की तानाशाही में लौट गया था।"" निर्णायक वोट डालने वाली न्यायमूर्ति कारमेन लूसिया ने तख्तापलट के प्रयास की तुलना एक ऐसे ""वायरस"" से की जो समाज को खत्म कर सकता है, इस बात पर जोर देते हुए कि ""तानाशाही के प्रति कोई प्रतिरक्षा नहीं थी।"" पैनल में एकमात्र असहमति वाली आवाज़, लुइज़ फक्स ने तर्क दिया कि बोल्सोनारो के खिलाफ आरोप निराधार थे।",en,[],,The former president has been found guilty of trying to mount coup to cling to power after he lost the election.,[''],www.bbc.com/news/world/latin_america,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four out of five Supreme Court justices tasked with trying the former president concluded he led a conspiracy to overturn his 2022 election loss to left-wing rival Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. One justice acquitted him. Here, we recap some of the basics you need to know about the trial. What has Bolsonaro been found guilty of? AFP via Getty Images Alexandre de Moraes was one of the five Supreme Court justices tasked with delivering a verdict in the trial Bolsonaro has been convicted on the following five charges: Armed criminal conspiracy Attempted abolition of the democratic rule of law Attempted coup d'état Violent destruction of public property Damage to protected national heritage sites The charges all relate to the former president's attempt to stay in power after he was beaten by Lula in the election in October 2022. The justices said that he knew of a plot which included plans to assassinate Lula and his vice-presidential running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, and to arrest and execute Alexandre de Moraes - the Supreme Court justice who has been overseeing Bolsonaro's trial. The conspiracy was thwarted because it failed to get the backing of the army and air force commanders. Lula was sworn in without incident on 1 January 2023. But a week later, on 8 January, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed and vandalised government buildings in the capital, Brasília. The security forces intervened and around 1,500 people were arrested. The justices found that the rioters had been incited by Bolsonaro whose plan, they said, was for the Brazilian military to intervene, restore order and bring him back to power. What was Bolsonaro's defence? Bolsonaro vehemently denied all the allegations. He pointed out that he was in the US on 8 January 2023 and said that he was the victim of a ""witch hunt"". He maintained that the charges were politically motivated and designed to prevent him from running again in the 2026 presidential election. While Bolsonaro is already barred from running for public office until 2030 for falsely claiming that Brazil's voting system was vulnerable to fraud, he had declared his intention to fight that ban so he could stand for a second term in 2026. He and his lawyers also questioned the impartiality of the Supreme Court panel tasked with judging him and his co-defendants. Bolsonaro has long viewed Alexandre de Moraes as his nemesis, calling the judge a ""dictator"" and accusing him of abusing his power. He also pointed out that two of the other justices on the panel had close links to Lula. One of those justices, Cristiano Zanin, was Lula's defence lawyer between 2013 and 2023 and in that role helped quash his corruption conviction. Another, Flávio Dino, served as Lula's justice minister from 2023 to 2024. What happens next? The Supreme Court sentenced Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison shortly after convicting him of plotting the coup. But he will not be transferred to a prison until his lawyers have exhausted all legal recourses. His lawyers are expected to raise questions about the length of the sentence and argue for leniency or plead for Bolsonaro to be kept under house arrest rather than be sent to prison. However, an appeal against the verdict itself would only have been possible if two out of the five justices had voted to acquit. Where is Bolsonaro now? Bolsonaro has been following the trial from his home in Brasília. He was placed under house arrest at the beginning of August after a police report alleged that he and his son, Eduardo, had tried to interfere in the trial. Police said they had found a document on Jair's mobile phone - dating back to February 2024 - which suggested he had planned to evade criminal proceedings by seeking asylum in Argentina. They also accused Eduardo of lobbying the Trump administration on behalf of his father and banned father and son from communicating with each other. What are the links between Bolsonaro and Trump? Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images Trump hosted Bolsonaro at Mar-a-Lago in 2020 The US president had drawn parallels between what is happening to Bolsonaro and his own legal battles in the past following his refusal to accept defeat in the 2020 US election. Asked about Bolsonaro's conviction on Thursday, he said: ""It's very much what they tried to do with me, but they didn't get away with it at all."" US Secretary of State Marco Rubio slammed the ruling, saying Washington ""will respond accordingly to this witch hunt"". The two men also have family ties, as their sons are friends. Eduardo Bolsonaro has been lobbying the Trump administration to pressure the Brazilian government to stop the trial. Back in July, Trump raised tariffs on Brazilian imports to 50%, citing the country's treatment of Bolsonaro as a trigger for the hike. Following his father's conviction, Eduardo Bolsonaro said he expected additional US sanctions to be slapped on Brazilian officials. Who were Bolsonaro's co-defendants? Bolsonaro was not the only one on trial. Seven men, all of them close allies of his, were found guilty of being his co-conspirators. They are: Alexandre Ramagem, former spy chief Adm Almir Garnier Santos, former navy commander Anderson Torres, former security minister Gen Augusto Heleno, former minister for institutional security Mauro Cid, Bolsonaro's former assistant Gen Walter Braga Netto, former defence minister Gen Paulo Sérgio Nogueira de Oliveira, former defence minister. All of them have been convicted of the three most serious charges, that is armed criminal conspiracy, attempted abolition of the democratic rule of law and attempted coup d'état. All with the exception of Alexander Ramagem have also been found guilty of the two lesser charges of damaging property and national heritage sites. What is Bolsonaro known for? His presidency was characterised by his confrontational style, which his supporters praised as ""unfiltered"" and ""genuine"" but which his critics derided as ""foul-mouthed"". When Brazil became one of the countries hardest hit by the Covid outbreak, Bolsonaro's handling of the response to the pandemic came under the spotlight. His dismissal of Covid as ""a little flu"" caused outrage among those who had lost family members to the virus. Internationally, he came under criticism for cutting the budget of agencies tasked with protecting indigenous peoples and the environment, prompting some to label him as ""a danger to the Amazon"". But his conservative stance also inspired fierce loyalty among his supporters, many of whom have continued to back him throughout his legal battles, holding prayer meetings and mass demonstrations to show their continued support for him and demand he be acquitted. When was Bolsonaro elected? AFP via Getty Images Bolsonaro was sworn in on 1 January 2019 Bolsonaro comfortably beat the candidate of the left-wing Workers' Party, Fernando Haddad, in the 2018 presidential election. The Workers' Party had been rocked by corruption scandals and many Brazilians said they were ready for a change after what had been four rocky years in Brazilian politics. The previous elected president, Dilma Rousseff of the Workers' Party, had been impeached in 2016 for manipulating the budget. Her vice-president, Michel Temer, served out the remainder of her term but was deeply unpopular. The best-known politician in the Workers' Party, Lula, was barred from running for office at the time because he had been convicted of corruption. The Workers' Party was left in disarray by the barring of its top candidate and ended up fielding the little-known Haddad at the last moment, who went on to lose the election to Bolsonaro. Lula's corruption convictions were quashed years later, and he went on to beat Bolsonaro in the 2022 election. What did he do before becoming president?

Four out of five Supreme Court justices concluded Bolsonaro was guilty of five charges related to his attempt to remain in power. These included his knowledge of a plot to assassinate Lula and his running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, which failed to gain military backing. He was also found to have incited the January 8, 2023, riots in Brasília, where thousands of his supporters stormed government buildings with the aim of provoking military intervention to restore him to power.

Bolsonaro vehemently denied all allegations, calling the charges a ""witch hunt"" and politically motivated, designed to prevent him from running in the 2026 presidential election. He noted his absence from Brazil on the day of the riots and questioned the Supreme Court panel's impartiality, citing his long-standing animosity with Justice Alexandre de Moraes and the close ties of two other justices (Cristiano Zanin and Flávio Dino) to Lula. Bolsonaro is already barred from public office until 2030 for falsely claiming Brazil's voting system was vulnerable to fraud.

Seven of Bolsonaro's close allies were also convicted as co-conspirators on charges including armed criminal conspiracy, attempted abolition of the democratic rule of law, and attempted coup d'état. Most were also found guilty of damaging property and national heritage sites.

Bolsonaro has been following the trial from his home in Brasília, having been placed under house arrest in August after police alleged he and his son, Eduardo, attempted to interfere in the trial, including a plan for Bolsonaro to seek asylum in Argentina. Father and son are currently banned from communicating.

The case has drawn parallels with former US President Donald Trump's own legal battles. US Senator Marco Rubio reportedly criticized the ruling as a ""witch hunt.""

Eduardo anticipates further US sanctions on Brazilian officials following his father's conviction.

Bolsonaro's presidency (2019-2022) was marked by a confrontational style, his dismissal of Covid-19 as ""a little flu,"" and international criticism for cuts to environmental and indigenous protection agencies. He was elected in 2018 amidst widespread corruption scandals involving the left-wing Workers' Party.","ब्राजील के पूर्व राष्ट्रपति जायर बोल्सोनारो को 27 साल और तीन महीने जेल की सज़ा सुनाई गई है। ब्राजील के सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने उन्हें 2022 में लुइज़ इनासियो लूला डा सिल्वा से अपनी चुनावी हार को पलटने की साज़िश का नेतृत्व करने का दोषी ठहराया है। बोल्सोनारो फिलहाल घर में नज़रबंद हैं और उन्हें तब तक जेल नहीं भेजा जाएगा जब तक उनके वकील सभी कानूनी अपीलों का रास्ता समाप्त नहीं कर देते।

सुप्रीम कोर्ट के पांच में से चार न्यायाधीशों ने निष्कर्ष निकाला कि बोल्सोनारो सत्ता में बने रहने के अपने प्रयास से संबंधित पांच आरोपों के दोषी थे। इनमें लूला और उनके साथी उम्मीदवार, गेराल्डो अल्कमिन की हत्या की साज़िश की उनकी जानकारी भी शामिल थी, जिसे सैन्य समर्थन नहीं मिल पाया था। उन्हें 8 जनवरी, 2023 को ब्रासीलिया में हुए दंगों को भड़काने का भी दोषी पाया गया था, जहाँ उनके हजारों समर्थकों ने उन्हें सत्ता में बहाल करने के लिए सैन्य हस्तक्षेप को उकसाने के उद्देश्य से सरकारी इमारतों पर धावा बोल दिया था।

बोल्सोनारो ने सभी आरोपों का ज़ोरदार खंडन किया, इन आरोपों को ""चुड़ैल शिकार"" और राजनीतिक रूप से प्रेरित बताया, जिसका उद्देश्य उन्हें 2026 के राष्ट्रपति चुनाव लड़ने से रोकना था। उन्होंने दंगों के दिन ब्राजील में अपनी अनुपस्थिति का उल्लेख किया और सुप्रीम कोर्ट पैनल की निष्पक्षता पर सवाल उठाया, जिसमें न्यायमूर्ति अलेक्जेंडर डी मोरेस के साथ अपनी लंबे समय से चली आ रही दुश्मनी और अन्य दो न्यायाधीशों (क्रिस्टियानो ज़ैनिन और फ्लेवियो डिनो) के लूला के साथ घनिष्ठ संबंधों का हवाला दिया। बोल्सोनारो को ब्राजील की मतदान प्रणाली में धोखाधड़ी की आशंका होने का झूठा दावा करने के लिए पहले ही 2030 तक सार्वजनिक पद से प्रतिबंधित कर दिया गया है।

बोल्सोनारो के सात करीबी सहयोगियों को भी सह-साजिशकर्ता के रूप में दोषी ठहराया गया, जिन पर सशस्त्र आपराधिक साज़िश, लोकतांत्रिक कानून के शासन को समाप्त करने का प्रयास और तख्तापलट का प्रयास जैसे आरोप थे। अधिकांश को संपत्ति और राष्ट्रीय विरासत स्थलों को नुकसान पहुँचाने का भी दोषी पाया गया।

बोल्सोनारो ब्रासीलिया स्थित अपने घर से ही मुकदमे पर नज़र रख रहे हैं, उन्हें अगस्त में घर में नज़रबंद किया गया था। पुलिस ने आरोप लगाया था कि उन्होंने और उनके बेटे एडुआर्डो ने मुकदमे में हस्तक्षेप करने का प्रयास किया था, जिसमें बोल्सोनारो के अर्जेंटीना में शरण लेने की योजना भी शामिल थी। पिता और बेटे को फिलहाल एक-दूसरे से बातचीत करने की अनुमति नहीं है।

इस मामले की तुलना अमेरिका के पूर्व राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप की अपनी कानूनी लड़ाइयों से की गई है। अमेरिकी सीनेटर मार्को रुबियो ने कथित तौर पर इस फैसले को ""चुड़ैल शिकार"" बताकर इसकी आलोचना की। एडुआर्डो बोल्सोनारो ने ट्रंप प्रशासन से ब्राजील सरकार पर दबाव डालने के लिए पैरवी की है, और ट्रंप ने पहले बोल्सोनारो के साथ किए गए व्यवहार का हवाला देते हुए ब्राजील के आयातों पर शुल्क बढ़ाया था। एडुआर्डो को अपने पिता की दोषसिद्धि के बाद ब्राजील के अधिकारियों पर और अमेरिकी प्रतिबंधों की आशंका है।

बोल्सोनारो के राष्ट्रपति कार्यकाल (2019-2022) की पहचान एक टकरावपूर्ण शैली, कोविड-19 को ""एक छोटा सा फ्लू"" बताकर खारिज करने और पर्यावरण तथा स्वदेशी संरक्षण एजेंसियों में कटौती के लिए अंतरराष्ट्रीय आलोचना से थी। उन्हें 2018 में वामपंथी वर्कर्स पार्टी से जुड़े व्यापक भ्रष्टाचार घोटालों के बीच चुना गया था।",en,[],,"As the trial of the former Brazilian president draws to a close, we recap some of the basics of the case.",[''],www.bbc.com/news/world/latin_america,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The altercation, which occurred after the national anthem, was triggered by Moreno's anger at not being allowed to speak during a heated discussion about the presence of foreign armed forces on Mexican soil.

Moreno reportedly grabbed Noroña, and after pushing and shoving, threw punches, injuring a photographer who intervened. He was subsequently arrested and charged with two counts of assault. In response, the Senate leader announced plans for an emergency session to propose expelling Moreno and three other opposition lawmakers who joined the fray. The underlying debate on foreign armed forces is expected to continue through the week.","यहाँ अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

Four out of the five Supreme Court justices tasked with judging the former leader found him guilty. One judge voted to acquit him. The 70-year-old has been convicted of leading a conspiracy aimed at keeping him in power after he lost the 2022 election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. While the plot failed to enlist enough support from the military to go ahead, it did culminate in the storming of government buildings by Bolsonaro's supporters on 8 January 2023, the justices found. The charges carry heavy sentences and could add up to a prison term of more than 40 years. The justices have begun with the sentencing. Casting the decisive vote, Justice Cármen Lúcia said on Thursday that Bolsonaro had triggered the ""insurgency"" of 8 January 2023, when thousands of his supporters vandalised the Supreme Court, the presidential palace, and Congress. She found him guilty on all the five charges: attempting to stage a coup, leading an armed criminal organisation, attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, and two more charges related to the damage of property during the storming of buildings in Brasília on 8 January 2023. Bolsonaro has always maintained his innocence and has called the trial a ""witch hunt"", arguing it was politically motivated. His lawyers are expected to lodge appeals. Bolsonaro has not been in court for any of the sessions of the final phase of the trial. His lawyers cited health reasons for his decision to follow proceedings from his home in Brasília. He was stabbed in the stomach on the campaign trail in 2018 and has been having recurrent health problems since. He has been under house arrest since the beginning of August after a police report alleged that he and his son, Eduardo, had tried to interfere in the trial. His lawyer was present in court but left after Justice Lúcia had declared his client guilty of the attempted coup and armed criminal conspiracy, even before she had finished speaking. The charges against Bolsonaro did not just relate to events of 8 January 2023. Prosecutors said he had started to plot to stay in power long before, proposing launching a coup to military commanders and sowing unfounded doubts about the electoral system. They also said that he knew of a plan to assassinate Lula, his vice-presidential running mate, and a Supreme Court Justice. Justice Lúcia compared the attempted coup to a ""virus"", which, if left to fester, can kill the society in which it has taken hold in. She added: ""I hope that this trial will prove a cure so that it doesn't come back. Relapses aren't good.""","Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been found guilty by the country's Supreme Court of plotting a coup attempt to remain in power after his 2022 election defeat.

ब्राजील के पूर्व राष्ट्रपति जायर बोल्सोनारो को देश के सुप्रीम कोर्ट ने 2022 के चुनाव में अपनी हार के बाद सत्ता में बने रहने के लिए तख्तापलट की साजिश रचने का दोषी ठहराया है। मामले की सुनवाई कर रहे पांच में से चार न्यायाधीशों ने उन्हें दोषी ठहराने के पक्ष में मतदान किया।

70 वर्षीय बोल्सोनारो को एक ऐसी साजिश का नेतृत्व करने का दोषी ठहराया गया, जिसका उद्देश्य उनके वामपंथी प्रतिद्वंद्वी लुइज़ इनासियो लूला डा सिल्वा को राष्ट्रपति पद संभालने से रोकना था। हालांकि, इस साजिश को पर्याप्त सैन्य समर्थन नहीं मिल पाया, लेकिन 8 जनवरी, 2023 को बोल्सोनारो के समर्थकों द्वारा सरकारी इमारतों पर धावा बोलने और उनमें तोड़फोड़ करने के रूप में यह परिणत हुई।

जस्टिस कार्मेन लूसिया, जिन्होंने बोल्सोनारो को सभी पांच आरोपों में दोषी पाया, ने कहा कि उन्होंने ""विद्रोह"" को हवा दी थी और उन पर तख्तापलट का प्रयास करने, एक सशस्त्र आपराधिक संगठन का नेतृत्व करने, लोकतांत्रिक कानून के शासन को हिंसक रूप से समाप्त करने का प्रयास करने और संपत्ति को नुकसान पहुंचाने से संबंधित दो आरोप लगाए। उन्होंने तख्तापलट के प्रयास को ""वायरस"" बताया और उम्मीद जताई कि यह मुकदमा ""इलाज"" का काम करेगा।

इन आरोपों में गंभीर दंड का प्रावधान है, जिससे उन्हें 40 साल से अधिक की जेल हो सकती है, और सजा सुनाने की सुनवाई अभी जारी है।

बोल्सोनारो ने लगातार खुद को निर्दोष बताया है, उन्होंने इस मुकदमे को ""राजनीतिक प्रतिशोध"" और राजनीति से प्रेरित बताया है। उनके वकील फैसले के खिलाफ अपील दायर करने वाले हैं।

पूर्व राष्ट्रपति मुकदमे के अंतिम चरणों में मौजूद नहीं थे, उन्होंने 2018 की चाकूबाजी की घटना से उत्पन्न चल रही स्वास्थ्य समस्याओं का हवाला दिया। कथित तौर पर वह अगस्त से घर में नजरबंद हैं, और एक पुलिस रिपोर्ट में आरोप लगाया गया है कि उन्होंने और उनके बेटे एडुआर्डो ने मुकदमे में हस्तक्षेप करने का प्रयास किया था।

अभियोजकों ने तर्क दिया कि बोल्सोनारो की साजिश 8 जनवरी, 2023 से काफी पहले शुरू हो गई थी, जिसमें सैन्य कमांडरों को तख्तापलट के प्रस्ताव देना और चुनावी प्रणाली के बारे में निराधार संदेह फैलाना शामिल था। उन्होंने यह भी आरोप लगाया कि उन्हें लूला और एक सुप्रीम कोर्ट के न्यायाधीश की हत्या की योजना की जानकारी थी।",en,[],,The right-wing former leader could be sentenced to decades in prison after he was convicted by Brazil's Supreme Court.,[''],www.bbc.com/news/world/latin_america,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mr Guo, 20, was released on Saturday. He has been ordered to pay a $30,000 (£22,332) donation and is banned from entering Chilean territory for three years. American pilot Ethan Guo has been released from a Chilean air base in Antarctica after being detained for two months for allegedly illegally landing his plane in the country's territory.

He is expected to donate his penalty to childhood cancer research within 30 days. He must also leave the country as soon as possible. The BBC has contacted Mr Barrientos Ramírez for comment. Ethan Guo was 19 when he embarked on his journey to become the youngest person to fly solo to every continent, and simultaneously hoped to raise $1m (£740,300) for cancer research through St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. Having already visited six of seven continents, in June he flew his small Cessna 182Q aircraft from the city of Punta Arenas, near the southernmost point of Chile, to King George Island off the Atlantic coast. The island is claimed by Chile and named after the UK's King George III. Mr Guo, who is originally from Tennessee, was taken into custody after landing on the island, which is home to a number of international research stations and their staff. Authorities said he submitted a plan to fly over Punta Arenas, but not beyond that, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. He was charged on 29 June with allegedly handing false information to ground control and landing without authorisation, but these were dropped by a judge last month. He has previously said he wants to continue with his original mission once able to leave the military base.","**American Pilot Ethan Guo Released from Antarctic Detention with Conditions**

Ethan Guo, a 20-year-old American pilot and influencer, has been released from a Chilean air base on King George Island in Antarctica after being detained for two months. Guo was initially accused of illegally landing his Cessna 182Q aircraft without permission and submitting a false flight plan in June, during his attempt to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents to raise $1 million for cancer research.

While the initial charges related to the unauthorized landing were reportedly dropped last month, Guo was subsequently arrested last week on suspicion of assaulting a police officer, leading to his recent release.

As part of his release agreement, Guo has been ordered to pay a $30,000 donation to a childhood cancer research charity of his choice within 30 days. He is also banned from entering Chilean territory for three years and must leave the country as soon as possible. His lawyer, Jaime Barrientos Ramírez, expressed disagreement with the legal process but noted its closure. Guo, who was 19 when he embarked on his charity mission, has stated his intention to continue his journey once he is able to depart the military base.","**अमेरिकी पायलट एथन गुओ अंटार्कटिक हिरासत से शर्तों के साथ रिहा**

हालांकि, अवैध लैंडिंग से संबंधित शुरुआती आरोप पिछले महीने कथित तौर पर हटा दिए गए थे, गुओ को पिछले हफ्ते बाद में एक पुलिस अधिकारी पर हमला करने के संदेह में गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया था, जिसके बाद उनकी हालिया रिहाई हुई है।

अपनी रिहाई समझौते के तहत, गुओ को 30 दिनों के भीतर अपनी पसंद के एक बचपन के कैंसर अनुसंधान चैरिटी को $30,000 का दान देने का आदेश दिया गया है। उन्हें चिली के क्षेत्र में तीन साल तक प्रवेश करने पर भी प्रतिबंध लगा दिया गया है और उन्हें जल्द से जल्द देश छोड़ना होगा। उनके वकील, जैमे बारिएंटोस रामिरेज़ ने कानूनी प्रक्रिया से असहमति व्यक्त की, लेकिन प्रक्रिया के संपन्न होने की बात कही। गुओ, जो अपनी धर्मार्थ यात्रा पर निकले थे तब 19 वर्ष के थे, ने कहा है कि सैन्य अड्डे से निकलने में सक्षम होने के बाद वह अपनी यात्रा जारी रखेंगे।",en,[],,"Ethan Guo, 20, had been detained since June after being accused of landing his Cessna illegally in Chilean territory in the Antarctic.",[''],www.bbc.com/news/world/latin_america,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His critics have praised the proceedings as necessary to bring closure, and to set a precedent that trying to undermine democracy will not be tolerated. Trump has said he is ""very unhappy"" with the verdict and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US would ""respond accordingly to this witch hunt"". Bolsonaro's son Eduardo, who has been lobbying in the US on his father's behalf, said he expects the US to impose more sanctions. The US had already sanctioned the Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes. His supporters, who include President Donald Trump, have described the trial as political persecution. Trump used it as an excuse to impose 50% tariffs on Brazil. For years, Bolsonaro has fiercely divided the country into those who love him and those who hate him. He now faces a 27-year prison sentence, after four out of five of Brazil's Supreme Court justices found him guilty. Ex-President Jair Bolsonaro has been convicted of attempting a coup and leading an armed criminal group after losing the last election, which culminated in his supporters attacking government buildings. This trial has gripped Brazil, as millions have seen it live-streamed on social media and television into their homes. And the story line has been no less dramatic than a TV series. Many people may remember the shocking moments when thousands of Bolsonaro supporters attacked government buildings on 8 January 2023, in scenes reminiscent of the 6 January Capitol riots in the US two years before. But throughout the course of this trial, many gobsmacking pieces of evidence have been revealed and read out in court. These include that a plan, drafted by Bolsonaro's allies, for elite armed forces personnel to assassinate the president-elect Luiz Inacio ""Lula"" da Silva, his running mate, and the Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes was printed out at the presidential palace. It listed ""poison"" as a method to kill Lula. Bolsonaro's lawyer was visibly incensed on behalf of his client, when he argued there was no evidence linking Bolsonaro to this plot or the 8 January riots. The court was also reminded of Bolsonaro's attempts to cast doubt on the electoral system. These included him holding a meeting with foreign ambassadors at the presidential palace to make false claims about electronic voting machines before the election, and public bodies obstructing voters from getting to polling stations – under the guise of ""checking the condition of vehicles"" – on the day of the vote. At various moments throughout this trial, the judges referred to Brazil's past. Its democracy is young – it was only restored in 1985 after two decades of a dictatorship, instigated by a military coup, backed by the US. To Bolsonaro's critics, the parallels were chilling. The judge leading this case – Alexandre de Moraes – said Brazil risked ""slowly forgetting"" that it nearly returned to a dictatorship because ""a criminal organisation, comprised of a political group, doesn't know how to lose elections"". Brazil's past has been littered with coups or attempted coups, but no one has ever sat in the dock, and past plotters have been granted amnesty. Bolsonaro's critics hope this verdict sends a clear signal: no more. So what happens next? Bolsonaro's sentence is, effectively, a life one for the 70-year-old. The judges said at least 24 years and 9 months of this should be spent in jail. He will likely try to appeal the sentence length and ask for it to be turned into a house arrest – something he is already on. Jair Bolsonaro didn't appear in the courtroom for the verdicts. His lawyer has cited health reasons. He has suffered various health problems after he was stabbed at a presidential campaign rally in 2018, before he took office. There is a precedent in Brazil of convicts being granted house arrest due to age or health reasons. Congress – where Bolsonaro's party has a majority – is also trying to push through legislation that would grant him amnesty. One of the right-wing frontrunners for next year's presidential election, who is courting Bolsonaro's support, has said he would give Bolsonaro amnesty if elected. So, while this ruling is an important milestone, his punishment still remains unclear.","Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has been convicted by Brazil's Supreme Court of attempting a coup and leading an armed criminal group, facing a 27-year prison sentence. The ruling, delivered by four of Brazil's five Supreme Court justices, is expected to further polarize a nation already deeply divided by Bolsonaro's leadership.

Critics have lauded the verdict as a crucial precedent, asserting that attempts to undermine democracy will no longer be tolerated and providing a sense of closure. Conversely, Bolsonaro's supporters, including former U.S. President Donald Trump, have vehemently condemned the trial as ""political persecution"" and a ""witch hunt."" Trump, who expressed ""very unhappiness"" with the verdict and previously imposed 50% tariffs on Brazil, along with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, hinted at a U.S. response. Bolsonaro's son, Eduardo, anticipates additional U.S. sanctions, following previous sanctions imposed by the U.S. and European Court of Justice on Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes, who presided over the case.

The high-profile trial, live-streamed to millions, revealed dramatic evidence. This included a plot drafted by Bolsonaro's allies to assassinate then President-elect Luiz Inacio ""Lula"" da Silva, explicitly listing ""poison"" as a method. Bolsonaro was also found guilty of inciting the January 8, 2023 attacks on government buildings by his supporters, reminiscent of the U.S. Capitol riots. Further evidence included his attempts to discredit Brazil's electronic voting system through false claims to foreign ambassadors and public bodies obstructing voters on election day.

Judges repeatedly emphasized Brazil's young democracy, restored in 1985 after a U.S.-backed military dictatorship. Lead judge Alexandre de Moraes warned against ""slowly forgetting"" how close the country came to authoritarianism due to a ""criminal organisation"" unwilling to accept electoral defeat. Historically, coup plotters in Brazil have often received amnesty, making this conviction a significant departure.

Bolsonaro, who did not appear for the verdict citing health reasons related to a 2018 stabbing, is expected to appeal the sentence, likely seeking house arrest due to his age and health, for which there is precedent. However, the ultimate outcome remains uncertain; his party, which holds a majority in Congress, is attempting to push through amnesty legislation, and at least one presidential frontrunner has pledged amnesty if elected. Despite the conviction, Bolsonaro's final punishment is yet to be fully determined.","यहाँ अंग्रेजी समाचार सारांश का हिंदी अनुवाद है:

आलोचकों ने इस फैसले को एक महत्वपूर्ण मिसाल बताते हुए सराहा है, यह दावा करते हुए कि लोकतंत्र को कमजोर करने के प्रयासों को अब बर्दाश्त नहीं किया जाएगा और इसने एक संतोष की भावना प्रदान की है। इसके विपरीत, बोल्सोनारो के समर्थकों ने, जिनमें पूर्व अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप भी शामिल हैं, इस मुकदमे को ""राजनीतिक उत्पीड़न"" और ""विच हंट"" (चुड़ैल शिकार) बताकर कड़ी निंदा की है। ट्रंप ने, जिन्होंने इस फैसले पर ""बहुत असंतोष"" व्यक्त किया था और जिन्होंने पहले ब्राजील पर 50% शुल्क लगाया था, अमेरिकी विदेश मंत्री मार्को रुबियो के साथ मिलकर अमेरिका की ओर से प्रतिक्रिया की ओर इशारा किया है। बोल्सोनारो के बेटे, एडुआर्डो को अतिरिक्त अमेरिकी प्रतिबंधों की आशंका है, जो मामले की अध्यक्षता करने वाले सुप्रीम कोर्ट के न्यायाधीश Alexandre de Moraes पर अमेरिका और यूरोपीय कोर्ट ऑफ जस्टिस द्वारा लगाए गए पिछले प्रतिबंधों के बाद आ सकते हैं।

लाखों लोगों द्वारा सीधे प्रसारित किए गए इस हाई-प्रोफाइल मुकदमे में नाटकीय सबूत सामने आए। इसमें बोल्सोनारो के सहयोगियों द्वारा तत्कालीन राष्ट्रपति-निर्वाचित लुइज़ इनासियो ""लूला"" दा सिल्वा की हत्या करने की एक साजिश शामिल थी, जिसमें स्पष्ट रूप से ""जहर"" को एक तरीका बताया गया था। बोल्सोनारो को अपने समर्थकों द्वारा 8 जनवरी, 2023 को सरकारी इमारतों पर किए गए हमलों को उकसाने का भी दोषी पाया गया, जो अमेरिकी कैपिटल दंगों की याद दिलाते हैं। अन्य सबूतों में विदेशी राजदूतों से झूठे दावे करके ब्राजील की इलेक्ट्रॉनिक वोटिंग प्रणाली को बदनाम करने का उनका प्रयास और चुनाव के दिन मतदाताओं को बाधित करने वाले सार्वजनिक निकाय शामिल थे।

न्यायाधीशों ने ब्राजील के युवा लोकतंत्र पर बार-बार जोर दिया, जिसे 1985 में अमेरिका समर्थित सैन्य तानाशाही के बाद बहाल किया गया था। मुख्य न्यायाधीश Alexandre de Moraes ने चेतावनी दी कि एक ""आपराधिक संगठन"" द्वारा चुनावी हार स्वीकार न करने के कारण देश सत्तावाद के कितना करीब आ गया था, और हमें इसे ""धीरे-धीरे भूलने"" से बचना चाहिए। ऐतिहासिक रूप से, ब्राजील में तख्तापलट के साजिशकर्ताओं को अक्सर माफी मिली है, जिससे यह सजा एक महत्वपूर्ण बदलाव है।

बोल्सोनारो, जो 2018 में हुए चाकू हमले से संबंधित स्वास्थ्य कारणों का हवाला देते हुए फैसले के लिए पेश नहीं हुए थे, सजा के खिलाफ अपील करने की उम्मीद है, संभवतः अपनी उम्र और स्वास्थ्य के कारण घर में नजरबंदी (हाउस अरेस्ट) की मांग करेंगे, जिसके लिए मिसाल भी मौजूद है। हालांकि, अंतिम परिणाम अनिश्चित बना हुआ है; उनकी पार्टी, जिसके पास कांग्रेस में बहुमत है, माफी कानून पारित करने का प्रयास कर रही है, और कम से कम एक राष्ट्रपति पद के दावेदार ने चुने जाने पर माफी देने का वादा किया है। दोषसिद्धि के बावजूद, बोल्सोनारो की अंतिम सज़ा अभी पूरी तरह से निर्धारित नहीं हुई है।",en,[],,"The ex-president's conviction is a milestone critics will welcome, though his punishment remains unclear.",[''],www.bbc.com/news/world/latin_america,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Of the cases which HFW have been involved in, the most common counterparties that we've encountered are Nigerian organised criminal organisations,"" he says. ""They have been responsible for perpetrating several high value 'man-in-the-middle' frauds in recent years."" This type of fraud involves a hacker being able to intercept the communication between two parties, such as emails. The criminal then impersonates both in order to try to steal sensitive information, such as log-in details or financial data, or even to take control of a company's computer system. The cyber criminals then demand money to give back what they have stolen, or to give up their command of a firm's computers. HFW's data shows that such hacking is a growing problem for the shipping sector, both attacks on ships and ports. It says that between 2022 and 2023 the cost of dealing with an attack doubled to an average of $550,000 (£410,000). Meanwhile, in cases where cyber security experts cannot easily remove the hackers, HFW says the average cost of a ransom payment is now $3.2m. Henry Clack Lawyer Henry Clack has the unenviable task of needing to negotiate with criminal gangs Around 80% of world trade is carried by sea, and disruption can greatly increase shipping firms' costs, and leave them short of capacity. This, says John Stawpert, manager for environment and trade in the marine department of the International Chamber of Shipping (ICS), makes the maritime industry a prime target for cyber attacks, from both criminal gangs and hostile countries. ""Cyber security is a major concern for the shipping industry, given how interconnected the world is. Shipping has been listed as one of the top 10 targets for cyber criminals globally,"" he says. ""The impact can be quite significant if cyber criminals manage to disrupt your operations or, for example, carry out a ransomware attack."" And the rate of attacks is rocketing. A research group at the Netherlands' NHL Stenden University of Applied Sciences compiled data on shipping cyber attacks over the last few years, and found that the number shot up from just 10 in 2021 to at least 64 last year. Many incidents, says Jeroen Pijpker of the university's Maritime IT Security research group, are linked to the governments of four countries - Russia, China, North Korea and Iran. ""What we saw with one example was that equipment was being shipped to Ukraine, and then on a Telegram channel we see people giving information about what kind of targets to attack to get some kind of disruption in the logistical chain [of that delivery]."" Other attacks are purely for financial extortion, be it gangs from Nigeria or elsewhere. Getty Images As ships are increasingly digitally connected to the outside world, there are more ways for hackers to attack One reason for the recent rapid rise in cyber attacks is that there are now simply more routes for hackers to use. Over the last few years, the industry has become more digital, while new communication technologies, Elon Musk's Starlink satellite service, for example, have meant that ships have become more connected to the outside world. And therefore more hackable. In one incident last year, a US Navy chief was relieved of her duties after she had installed an unauthorised satellite dish on her combat ship, so that she and other officers could access the internet. Meanwhile, much of the official digitisation in the maritime industry has happened in a piecemeal way, and involves technology that can go rapidly out of date. The average cargo ship, says Pijpker, is around 22-years-old, and shipping companies can't afford to have them out of the water too often to update. Digitisation has brought other risks, too, including GPS jamming and ""spoofing"". ""GPS spoofing means sending the navigation system a false location, and this means that the ship takes a completely different route - it can even be damaged physically if it gets into shallow waters,"" says Arik Diamant of security firm Claroty. In May it was widely reported that a container ship called MSC Antonia had run aground in the Red Sea after a suspected GPS spoofing attack. While no suspect was accused in the reporting, Yemen's Houthi rebels have physically attacked other cargo ships in the area. Other examples of GPS targeting in the Baltic Sea have been blamed on Russia. Getty Images Port facilities are also being targeted by hackers","Cyberattacks targeting the global shipping industry are surging, causing significant financial losses and operational disruptions.  Nigerian criminal gangs are prominent perpetrators of ""man-in-the-middle"" email scams, demanding ransoms averaging $3.2 million.  The average cost of dealing with such attacks doubled in 2023 to $550,000.  This increase is attributed to the industry's growing digital connectivity, facilitated by technologies like Starlink, creating more vulnerabilities.  Research indicates a sharp rise in attacks, from 10 in 2021 to at least 64 in 2022, with some linked to state-sponsored actors (Russia, China, North Korea, Iran).  Attacks range from financial extortion to disrupting operations, including GPS spoofing incidents like the suspected grounding of the MSC Antonia.  Outdated technology on aging vessels and piecemeal digitization further exacerbate the problem, making the maritime sector a prime target for increasingly sophisticated cyber criminals.

But the list has very few women. In September 2021, a photograph from the Indian Supreme Court of then chief justice NV Ramana flanked by his four female colleagues went viral. This was the highest-ever tally of female judges in the 34-member top court and was hailed as a ""historic moment"". Many saw it as a turning point for India's top judiciary and expressed the hope that it would start reversing the skewed gender gap in India's top court. But four years later, that hope lies in tatters and the Supreme Court is back to being – as lawyer Sneha Kalita described it - ""a men's club"". Three of the women seen in that photograph with Justice Ramana - Justice Indira Banerjee, Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Bela M Trivedi – have since retired. And as no woman has been appointed to the top court since then, Justice BV Nagarathna is now the sole female judge there. ""This is alarming. It's nothing short of catastrophic,"" Ms Kalita, a member of an association of female advocates who have filed a petition in the Supreme Court demanding fair representation of women in courts, told the BBC. Historically, Indian judiciary has been dominated by men. From 1950, when the Supreme Court came into existence, it took 39 years for Justice Fathima Beevi to be appointed the country's first female judge in 1989. ""I opened a closed door,"" she told news website Scroll in 2018. But in 75 years, the court has welcomed very few women – only 11 out of the 287 judges or a measly 3.8%. ""With just one woman, we are back to near-zero representation in the top court. This has become a men's club,"" Ms Kalita says. Getty Images India's judiciary has been described as ""an old boy's club"" What is also troubling is that there are only 103 female judges compared with 670 males in the high courts - and at least four do not have a single woman. This low representation of women has come into sharp focus in recent weeks after the latest batch of appointments was made to the Supreme Court. The court had two vacancies to fill and it was expected that the Supreme Court collegium - which includes the chief justice and four senior-most judges and recommends names to the government - would use the opportunity to correct the acute gender imbalance. But in August-end, two high court judges - both male - were elevated to the role. Media reports say that at least three female high court judges in the country were more senior than one of the elevated judges. The collegium's other recent selections have also ignored women - Bombay High Court last week got 14 new judges, but only one was woman. For Allahabad High Court, the proposed list of 26 candidates includes only five women. This low representation of women in the top court as well as ""in high courts across the country"" prompted the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) to put out a strong statement expressing ""deep disappointment"" and ""grave concern"". SCBA president and senior lawyer Vikas Singh told the BBC that ""women make for 40% of all judges in lower judiciary, that is district courts and below, where recruitments are on merit and candidates are chosen through written exams and interviews"". ""But in higher judiciary where they are selected by the collegium, they make for less than 10%. Something very drastic needs to be done. Effort must be made to look for more women,"" he said. Most women lawyers the BBC spoke to welcomed the SCBA intervention. ""I'm glad the bar association has raised it, it's not a women's problem. It reflects on us as a society,"" said senior lawyer Madhavi Divan. Getty Images Justice Leila Seth was the first woman to become chief justice of a state high court - but she was never inducted in the top court","India's Supreme Court, once lauded for a ""historic"" increase in female judges, has regressed to a stark gender imbalance, with only one woman among 34 justices.  This follows a recent round of appointments that overlooked several senior female high court judges in favor of male counterparts.  The lack of female representation,  only 3.8% of all Supreme Court justices since its inception in 1950, has prompted widespread criticism.  The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) has voiced strong concern, highlighting the disparity between the 40% female representation in lower judiciary and the significantly lower percentage in higher courts.  Experts and lawyers alike decry the situation as a ""men's club,"" reflecting poorly on Indian society and urging immediate action to address this systemic issue.  The appointments to high courts also reveal a similar underrepresentation of women, with some courts having no female judges at all.  This persistent gender gap despite previous calls for change underscores a deep-seated problem within the Indian judicial system.

Four ways to get started 7 hours ago Share Save Alex Taylor BBC News, London Share Save Getty Images After the summer holidays, for many of us September feels like a fresh start. As the darker evenings loom we're likely to spend more time inside making it a natural time to start looking at our homes afresh and to think about decluttering. Tidying our living space can reduce stress and boost our energy levels, according to psychologists. But choosing what to keep and what to get rid of isn't easy, with many of us struggling to decide. BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour spoke to experts on the four best strategies to clear space in your home. Listen to the BBC Woman's Hour special: Decluttering here 1. Start small Getty Images The biggest challenge for many is starting the process, so it's important to give yourself permission to declutter. This includes throwing away items, including gifts, that have been kept through a sense of obligation rather than enjoyment. Going slowly is also a must, says writer and Interior Design Masters judge Michelle Ogundehin. ""It's not about thinking 'right, that's it! It's all got to go!' It's about taking it one step at a time,"" she explains. Ogundehin suggests picking an individual drawer or cupboard first, then building up gradually over time. This makes the task feel manageable rather than overwhelming. 2. Plan where to take your items Getty Images It is essential to plan ahead for what will happen to the items you discard. Ideally this should be before decluttering begins, or within the first few days. ""You don't want to have piles and piles of stuff building up in the hallway,"" says professional organiser Ingrid Jansen. As the co-founder of Declutter Hub, a community of over 60,000 members alongside a weekly podcast, she says there are ever increasing options for items to be donated, recycled, given away or disposed of. Consider charity shops, or giveaway apps like Freegle and Freecycle, or the tip for items which can't be reused. There's also the option to sell items second hand through online marketplaces such as Vinted or eBay. But, fellow Declutter Hub co-founder Lesley Spellman warns that the lure of upselling can be a double-edged sword. Despite our best intentions, it can lead to churning - the habit of packing items for disposal, without actually moving them on. ""Selling is a fantastic way to make money out of your clutter, but you have to exercise some realism,"" she says. If you're that person that's got three bin bags of stuff still under your desk, it may be time to get rid. 3. Prioritise quality not quantity Getty Images We've all heard the phrase ""be brutal!"", but effective decluttering doesn't mean discarding things you love for the sake of it. Instead, Ogundehin advises: ""surround yourself with the things that tell the story that you want them to tell"". ""Keep the things that reinforce you, that uplift you when you walk through the door,"" she adds, be that holiday purchases, pictures, or masterpieces by your children, nephews or nieces. Key to managing this is employing what Ogundehin terms ""containment"" - dedicating set spaces for objects, rather than spreading them endlessly throughout your home. 4. Distinguish between nostalgia and sentimentality Getty Images","Feeling overwhelmed by clutter after the summer?  BBC News offers expert advice on decluttering your home.  The key is to start small, focusing on a single drawer or cupboard.  Plan ahead for discarded items – donate, recycle, sell (but be wary of ""churning,""  keeping items intended for disposal), or responsibly dispose of them.  Prioritize quality over quantity, keeping only items that bring joy and tell your story.  Finally, distinguish between genuine sentimentality and mere nostalgia to avoid holding onto unnecessary items. Experts from BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour and interior design professionals offer practical strategies for a stress-reducing, energizing home refresh.

It says that Israel has breached the Genocide Convention that was passed in 1948 by the newly established United Nations. The word genocide, and the convention that defined it as a crime, were directly inspired by the genocide of six million Jews by Nazi Germany. Israel denies all allegations that its conduct in Gaza has broken the treaties and conventions that make up the laws of war and international humanitarian law. It justifies its actions as self-defence, in protection of its citizens and to force the release of the hostages taken by Hamas and Islamic Jihad on 7 October 2023, around 20 of whom are believed still to be alive. The Israelis have dismissed the report as antisemitic lies inspired by Hamas. It was compiled by a commission of inquiry set up by the UN Human Rights Council. Israel and the US are boycotting the Council, which both countries say is biased against them. But the findings of the report will feed into the growing international condemnation of Israel's conduct, which is also coming from Israel's traditional western allies as well as the Gulf Arab monarchies that normalised relations with Israel in the Abraham Accords. Live coverage of this story AFP via Getty Images Israel's military campaign - which has involved heavy air strikes and the controlled demolition of buildings and infrastructure - has left much of Gaza in ruins Next week at the UN General Assembly in New York, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Canada and others are due to join the majority of UN members by recognising the sovereignty of an independent Palestinian state. The move will be more than symbolic. It will change the debate about the future of the conflict that began more than a century ago when Zionist Jews from Europe came to settle in Palestine. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, has condemned recognition as antisemitic, and a reward for Hamas terrorism. He says the Palestinians will never have independence in any part of the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea, as a Palestinian state would put Israelis in danger. Israeli religious nationalists believe the land was granted to the Jewish people alone by God. Genocide is defined in the 1948 convention, as the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group – in this case, Palestinians in Gaza. AFP via Getty Images Multiple UN agencies have said a ""man-made famine"" is ongoing in parts of Gaza The report details actions against Palestinians inside Gaza and in jails inside Israel. Among a long list of accusations is Israeli targeting of civilians that it has a legal obligation to protect, and the imposition of ""inhumane conditions causing the death of Palestinians, including the deprivation of food, water and medicines"". That is a reference to the blockade that has produced a famine as well as widespread starvation, according to the IPC, the international body that assesses food emergencies. The new UN report also details forced displacement, currently happening in Gaza City after the Israeli military, the IDF, ordered all civilians there to move south. Around one million people are believed to be affected. Israel's offensive is gathering pace, with air strikes and the destruction of many buildings, including high rises that are symbols of Gaza City, which the IDF calls Hamas ""terror towers"". The report also says that Israel has imposed ""measures intended to prevent births"". That refers to an attack on Gaza's largest fertility clinic that reportedly destroyed around 4000 embryos and 1000 sperm samples and unfertilised eggs. As well as the results of military action, the UN report singles out three Israeli officials for inciting genocide. AFP via Getty Images Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (left), President Isaac Herzog (centre), and former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant (second from right), are accused of inciting genocide","A UN report accuses Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, citing evidence of actions violating the 1948 Genocide Convention.  The report, compiled by a UN Human Rights Council commission, details widespread alleged atrocities including the targeting of civilians, the imposition of inhumane conditions leading to famine, forced displacement of over one million people, and measures intended to prevent births.  Three Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, are accused of inciting genocide. Israel vehemently denies the accusations, claiming its actions are self-defense and in accordance with international law.  The report fuels international condemnation, despite Israel's dismissal of it as antisemitic.

The opening ceremony took place at the City of David, a biblical tourism site operated by the Elad settler organisation in the Palestinian neighbourhood of Silwan. America's top diplomat was a guest of honour at the opening of the so-called ""Pilgrimage Road"", a tunnel excavated under Palestinian homes next to Jerusalem's Old City. Residents of Silwan have for years faced eviction orders and home demolitions to make way for Jewish settlements and the expansion of the archaeological park, according to rights groups. Settlements are illegal under international law. Mr Rubio described the excavation as ""perhaps one of the most important archaeological sites on the planet"", saying it had deep meaning to people in the United States. He earlier said he understood ""people want to involve politics in it… But at the end of the day, it's an extraordinary archaeological site."" Silwan resident Fakhri Abu Diab, 63, said Mr Rubio was choosing to back extremists in the Israeli government instead of being on the side of international law. ""He is ignoring our [Palestinian] history. He isn't visiting when they are demolishing our homes, ethnic cleansing and kicking us out of here,"" he said. Mr Abu Diab spoke to the BBC next to the mangled wreckage of his home, which was demolished last year at the order of Israeli authorities. Israel says such homes are built without permits, but these are almost impossible for Palestinians to obtain. The City of David has been operated since the early 2000s by Elad, a settler group that has appropriated land, acquired Palestinian homes and pushed for the eviction of Palestinian families in Silwan, according to a July report by the UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Ze'ev Orenstein, director of international affairs at the City of David, told Reuters: ""All the archaeological excavations are carried out by the Israel Antiquities Authority according to the highest standards."" He declined to answer further questions. The excavation is said to mark the route of a Roman-era street taken by pilgrims to the site revered by Jews as the location of two Biblical temples. According to Peace Now, an Israeli campaign group that supports Palestinian rights, the tunnel stretches 600 metres from Silwan, running beneath Palestinian homes and the Old City walls, ending close to the foundations of the Western Wall, part of the retaining structure of the compound which hosts al-Aqsa mosque. The site is known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif and to Jews as the Temple Mount. Peace Now called Rubio's visit ""nothing less than American recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the most sensitive part of Jerusalem's Holy Basin"". The group added: ""[W]hat stands behind its opening is a trampling of Jerusalem as a city sacred to all faiths and belonging to all its residents.""","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to the City of David archaeological site in Jerusalem, a project run by the Israeli settler organization Elad in the Palestinian neighborhood of Silwan, has sparked controversy.  Blinken's presence at the opening of the ""Pilgrimage Road"" tunnel, excavated beneath Palestinian homes, is condemned by Palestinian groups as tacit US support for Israel's settlement expansion, deemed illegal under international law.  Residents of Silwan, facing evictions and demolitions to facilitate the project, accuse the US of ignoring human rights violations. While Blinken highlighted the site's archaeological significance,  critics like Silwan resident Fakhri Abu Diab, whose home was demolished last year, see the visit as endorsing Israeli policies that displace Palestinians.  The 600-meter tunnel, extending from Silwan to the Western Wall, is viewed by Peace Now as Israeli assertion of sovereignty over a highly sensitive area, sacred to multiple religions, and a disregard for Jerusalem's diverse population. The visit coincided with the 50th anniversary of the first Israeli-Palestinian talks.

President Lazarus Chakwera is vying for a second term, his main rival being Peter Mutharika, an octogenarian who has previously been in office. In the cities, campaigning has been overshadowed by fuel shortages, which have led to long, frustrating queues at petrol stations. The rising cost of living has also been a major concern of voters. A presidential run-off will be held if no candidate gets more than 50% of the votes cast in Tuesday's election. What are Malawians voting for? The 7.2 million registered voters will be taking part in three elections once polling stations open at 04:00 GMT: Presidential - there are 17 candidates to choose from - there are 17 candidates to choose from Parliamentary - 229 constituency MPs will be elected - 229 constituency MPs will be elected Local - 509 councillor positions are up for grabs. Who could be the next president? AFP via Getty Images Lazarus Chakwera (L) and Peter Mutharika (R) have faced each other at the ballot before Among the 17 hopefuls there are two clear front-runners. Chakwera and Mutharika will square off against each other at the polls for the fourth time - though the third time ended up not counting. Mutharika first defeated Chakwera in 2014, but when he was declared winner over Chakwera in the next election in 2019 the result was annulled. Chakwera won the re-run the following year. Lazarus Chakwera - Malawi Congress Party (MCP) Chakwera, a former theology lecturer and preacher, had no political experience when he emerged as leader of the MCP in 2013. When he ran for president in 2014 he was unsuccessful, but in 2020 he triumphed, beating the incumbent, Mutharika, in that unprecedented re-run. Chakwera's time in office has been marred by economic turmoil and allegations of corruption. The 70-year-old did, however, reintroduce train services in Malawi for the first time in over three decades. He has also overseen major road construction across the country. Peter Mutharika - Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Mutharika, an 85-year-old former lawyer and law lecturer, led Malawi from 2014 to 2020. He is the brother of the late President Bingu wa Mutharika, who died in office in 2012. Like Chakwera, Mutharika is also burdened by corruption allegations and links to economic crises. However, his supporters would argue that the current high inflation rate (around 27%) is proof that Mutharika managed the economy better than his successor. Mutharika's age may count against him this election - speculation about his health is rife, especially as he has rarely been seen out in public during the campaign period. Other contenders garnering attention are former president Joyce Banda (People's Party), current Vice-President Michael Usi (Odya Zake Alibe Mlandu) and former reserve bank governor Dalitso Kabambe (UTM). What are the key issues for voters? The economy Malawi has long been one of the poorest countries in the world, but the past few years have been especially punishing. The country was devastated by Cyclone Freddy that killed hundreds of people in 2023, then a drought swept across southern Africa the following year. Food prices skyrocketed due to a short supply of crops, pushing many Malawians into extreme poverty. Economists also put Malawi's current inflation problems partly down to the shortage of foreign currencies - known as ""forex"" - in the banks. In addition, Malawi has been forced to devalue its currency and was recently crippled by fuel shortages and nationwide power outages. Corruption When Chakwera came to power, he vowed to ""to clear the rubble of corruption"" that has long plagued Malawian politics. His administration says it has excelled in this area, but critics - including the influential Catholic Church - say this is not the case. Scepticism was sparked last year when the director of public prosecutions dropped corruption charges against high-profile figures. Additionally, the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has been without a director since former boss Martha Chizuma left more than a year ago. To some, the failure to appoint a new head actively hinders the fight against corruption. Previous administrations have also been dogged by graft allegations. For instance, the ACB accused Mutharika of receiving a kickback from a contract to supply food to the police - he denied any wrongdoing. Banda's reputation was dented by a scandal dubbed ""cashgate"" which happened under her watch. She was cleared by the ACB of any wrongdoing. The former vice-president's death In June last year, Vice-President Saulos Chilima died in a plane crash. Popular with the youth, Chilima led the UTM party and could have been a key contender in the upcoming elections, especially as he had fallen out with the president. Although two investigations - one carried out by Germany's aviation accidents agency and another by a Malawi government-appointed commission - did not find evidence of foul play, some Malawians remain suspicious of the authorities. Opposition parties have been fuelling this scepticism during their campaigns, referring to Chakwera's party as the ""Chikangawa Party"" (Chikangawa Forest being the site of the plane crash). Where the petrol queue might overshadow the queue to vote AFP via Getty Images Hundreds in Malawi lost their lives to Cyclone Freddy What has happened in previous elections? Malawi was governed by the MCP from its independence in 1964 until the country's first multi-party poll in 1994. Since the shift from a one-party state, the United Democratic Front, the DPP, the People's Party and the MCP have all enjoyed stints in power. Chakwera's victory with the MCP in 2020 was one of the most significant moments in the country's political history. A general election had taken place the year before and Mutharika was declared the winner. However, the Constitutional Court annulled the election, saying there had been widespread tampering, including the use of Tipp-Ex correction fluid on results sheets. Judges ordered a re-run for 2020, and Chakwera won with 59% of the vote after having teamed up with Chilima. Although Mutharika branded the re-run ""unacceptable"", the Constitutional Court gained international acclaim for safeguarding democracy and refusing to be influenced by presidential power. How will Tuesday's presidential vote work? Following the controversy of the 2019 election, Malawi implemented a new system, where a candidate must gain more than 50% of the total votes to win the presidency in the first round. There is a strong possibility that this year's candidates will not reach the threshold, meaning a run-off election will have to be held. The MCP and DPP will likely try to bring smaller parties on board in order to secure a majority in the second round. The electoral commission has up until the end of 24 September to announce the presidential result in Tuesday's poll and the end of 30 September for the parliamentary election. Counting is due to begin at polling stations as soon as voting ends at 14:00 GMT. Will the elections be free and fair? The court's actions following the 2019 vote have given some Malawians faith in the electoral process. However, over the past months, a number or civil society organisations and opposition parties have accused the electoral commission of favouring the MCP, alleging that its top management has links to the governing party. The commission has firmly denied being biased. A protest in June calling for the resignation of the commission's top officials was attacked by masked, machete-wielding men, leading to concerns about freedom of expression in the run-up to the election. The assault was not an isolated incident - there have been numerous reports of politically motivated violence ahead of the general election. More BBC stories about Malawi: Getty Images/BBC","Malawi holds presidential and parliamentary elections amidst a struggling economy and concerns over fairness.  Incumbent Lazarus Chakwera of the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) seeks a second term against his long-time rival, former President Peter Mutharika of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).  This marks their fourth electoral showdown, with Chakwera's 2020 victory following the annulment of the 2019 results.  The election also features other contenders, including former President Joyce Banda.  High inflation (around 27%), fuel shortages, and the lingering effects of Cyclone Freddy and drought are major concerns for voters.  Allegations of corruption against both Chakwera and Mutharika further complicate the race. A run-off is likely if no candidate secures over 50% of the vote.  Concerns persist about the electoral commission's impartiality and instances of politically motivated violence.  The outcome will significantly impact Malawi's economic and political trajectory.

Shares in Tesla, which have struggled to advance this year, jumped more than 6% in early trading on Monday on the news. Musk already held a roughly 13% stake in the company, but he has long sought more control of the firm, which he has been pushing to invest in robotaxis, automation and artificial intelligence (AI). The company's board recently proposed a compensation plan valued at roughly $1 trillion, which would grant Musk up to 12% of the firm's shares if the company reaches certain targets. The board also said it would grant him $29bn worth of shares last month as a separate ""interim"" award, after a larger pay package agreed in 2018 was struck down in a court battle. The proposals followed discussions with Musk, in which he demanded a 25% stake in the firm, at times threatening to quit Tesla entirely over the issue. Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said Musk was likely looking to build back his stake in Tesla, noting that ""markets like it"" when company leaders buy into their own companies because it suggests they feel positive about the firm's future performance. But she noted that there could also be other motivations at play. ""An inventive and ungenerous interpretation of Musk's actions is he saw the news about Larry Ellison becoming the world's richest man and decided to juice Tesla stock a bit to regain the title,"" she said. ""Stranger things have happened."" Musk's purchases of roughly 2.5 million shares were completed on Friday and disclosed in a filing with regulators on Monday. They mark his first open market stock purchases since 2020 and are a sign of his investment in the firm, which has been on the defensive this year. Musk has tried to focus investors on the promise of robotaxis and automation. But the company is grappling with falling sales, as competition heats up and the US ends tax breaks for electric car purchases. The firm's brand also took a hit as Musk has deepened his political involvement. He was a key supporter of US President Donald Trump in the 2024 election, before a dramatic falling out earlier this year. He has also rallied on behalf of far-right causes in the UK and Germany. On Monday, the British government accused Musk of using ""dangerous and inflammatory language"" when he appeared by video link at a rally organised by far-right activist Tommy Robinson in London on Saturday. Musk had told the crowds that violence was coming and they had to fight back or die.","Elon Musk purchased approximately $1 billion worth of Tesla stock last week, boosting Tesla shares by over 6% in early Monday trading.  This marks his first open market stock purchase since 2020 and increases his stake in the company, which is currently facing challenges including falling sales and increased competition.  While analysts suggest the purchase signals confidence in Tesla's future, particularly its focus on robotaxis and automation,  speculation also includes the possibility that Musk aimed to increase Tesla's stock value.  The purchase comes amidst a backdrop of Tesla's proposed, multi-billion dollar compensation plan for Musk,  and follows earlier disputes over his desired level of control within the company.  The news follows reports of Tesla's struggle to find buyers for its electric vehicles, in addition to the negative impact that Musk's recent political involvement has had on the company's brand.

He was narrowly confirmed on Monday with a vote of 48-47. Miran, who is chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, will be the first sitting White House official to join the Fed's board since its creation in its current form in the 1930s. The US Senate has cleared President Donald Trump's pick Stephen Miran to join the Federal Reserve's board of governors - part of a panel responsible for setting the country's interest rates. Miran is expected to take part in a key Fed policy meeting this week as one of 12 voting members, playing a central role in Trump's bid for a large interest rate cut. The Fed is expected to approve a quarter-percentage point rate cut to support a weakening labour market. Miran is a supporter of Trump's global tariffs, arguing the import duties won't fuel inflation and that policies like stricter immigration will reduce housing demand and lower prices. The White House economist's fast-tracked confirmation vote has proceeded in just a few weeks, when it typically takes months for a Fed governor nominee to be confirmed by the Senate. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, raised concerns that Miran would be seen as a ""puppet"" who would not be trusted as an independent voice on the Fed board. Trump has put pressure on the Fed for months, demanding interest rate cuts to give the US economy a boost and make it cheaper for the government to borrow. The president has taken aim at Fed chair Jerome Powell, calling him a ""numbskull"" and ""too late"". The Miran vote also comes as Trump is also attempting to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook from the central bank, citing allegations of mortgage fraud and constitutional powers to remove her. Cook, the first black woman to serve as a Fed governor, has denied the allegations and sued to block her removal. She has voted in recent months to keep interest rates on hold this year. On Monday, a US appeals court denied the justice department's request to lift an earlier ruling to temporarily block Trump from removing Cook. The Trump administration is also pursuing mortgage fraud investigations against Senator Adam Schiff and New York Attorney General Letitia James, both political antagonists of the president.","The Senate narrowly confirmed Stephen Miran, a White House economist and Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, to the Federal Reserve Board in a 48-47 vote.  This makes Miran the first sitting White House official to join the Fed's board in decades.  His swift confirmation, just weeks after nomination, allows him to participate in a key interest rate meeting this week, where a rate cut is anticipated.  Miran's appointment, pushed by President Trump who has publicly pressured the Fed for rate cuts, has drawn criticism from Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who voiced concerns about his independence.  The confirmation comes amidst Trump's ongoing attempts to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a move blocked by a court order, and parallel investigations into political opponents.  Miran, a supporter of Trump's trade policies, is expected to play a significant role in shaping the Fed's monetary policy.

Israeli strikes are also reported in central Gaza, in the direction in which thousands of people are fleeing. Palestinian officials say there are rising numbers of deaths and injuries. The intensification came ahead of a long-threatened full-scale ground invasion of the city, which is home to hundreds of thousands of people. It came hours after Secretary of State Marco Rubio assured Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of unwavering US support during a trip to Jerusalem on Monday. Early on Tuesday morning, Israel's defence minister, Israel Katz, wrote on X, ""Gaza is burning"" and threatened that Israel, ""will not relent and we will not go back - until the completion of the mission."" Local journalists in Gaza say there have been almost constant Israeli air strikes and artillery and gunfire in Gaza City. Homes are said to have been destroyed, with people trapped in the rubble. There has been no official confirmation of a new ground incursion from the Israeli military. Israel has demanded that Gaza City's residents leave and head south to a central area of the strip. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) estimate about 250,000 Palestinians have fled, though hundreds of thousands are believed to remain in the area. Some say they cannot afford to go south, while others say southern Gaza is not safe as Israel has carried out air strikes there too. Some have said they attempted to go south but were unable to pitch their tents, so returned to Gaza City. Reuters Israeli strikes on Gaza continued into Tuesday Rubio meanwhile was heading to visit Qatar next, where Arab leaders on Monday condemned Israel's attack last week on the capital Doha targeting, but reportedly failing to kill, Hamas leaders. Speaking from the tarmac at Ben Gurion airport, Rubio said Qatar was still the only country able to mediate on Gaza. Pressed by the BBC on the condemnation of Israel from Arab and Muslim countries in Doha on Monday, he said the US prefers that war ends in a negotiated settlement and hoped partners in the region ""stay engaged"". Rubio also said that there was ""a very short window"" in which a deal on Gaza could be made, Reuters and AFP reported. He added that Hamas had to ""cease to exist as an armed group"". In Israel, hostage families camped outside the Israeli prime minister's house overnight because they believe the current military strategy is putting their loved ones in danger. Some 48 hostages are believed to remain in Gaza with 20 believed to be alive. The escalation in bombardment on Gaza also comes after Netanyahu refused to rule out further strikes on Hamas leaders abroad despite international criticism of the attack on Qatar. Days earlier the White House said Trump had assured Qatar ""that such a thing will not happen again on their soil"" - an assertion that he repeated on Monday night. Qatar hosts a major US airbase and has played a key role in brokering diplomatic efforts to end the war in Gaza, serving as a mediator of indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel. It has hosted the Hamas political bureau since 2012. EPA Palestinians look for survivors in the rubble of the Al-Ghafari residential tower after it was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City, 15 September 2025.","Israel has dramatically escalated its bombardment of Gaza City, with Defense Minister Israel Katz declaring ""Gaza is burning"" and vowing a relentless campaign until its objectives are met.  Unconfirmed reports suggest a ground offensive has begun, aiming to occupy the entire city, while thousands flee towards areas also under attack.  Palestinian officials report a rising death toll and widespread injuries.  The intensified assault follows Secretary of State Marco Rubio's reaffirmation of unwavering US support for Israel during a visit to Jerusalem.  Amidst near-constant airstrikes and shelling, homes have been destroyed, leaving many trapped under rubble.  Israel has urged Gaza's residents to evacuate to southern Gaza, but many are unable or unwilling due to unsafe conditions and lack of resources.  An estimated 250,000 Palestinians have fled, but hundreds of thousands remain.  Meanwhile, hostage families in Israel protest the military strategy, fearing for the lives of the approximately 20 hostages still believed to be alive in Gaza.  Netanyahu's refusal to rule out further strikes on Hamas leaders abroad, despite international condemnation, further fuels the escalating conflict.  Despite Arab condemnation of Israel's recent attack on Qatar, Secretary Rubio emphasized the need for a negotiated settlement, highlighting a ""very short window"" for a deal contingent on Hamas's disarmament.  Qatar, a key mediator, remains a central player in potential negotiations.

Here's how to fix it 1 day ago Share Save Yasmin Rufo BBC News Share Save BBC When life gets busy and stress levels rise, it's not uncommon to find yourself walking into a room and forgetting why you went there, losing your train of thought mid-sentence or struggling to stay focused on simple tasks. Especially after the weekend, it can be hard to get back into work or study mode. This mental cloudiness is often called brain fog and while it isn't a medical condition in itself, it refers to a collection of cognitive symptoms such as difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and mental slowness. Common causes of it can include menopause or perimenopause, and conditions such as long Covid and autoimmune conditions like lupus disease, but it can also strike when you've got too much on your mind at once. Medical doctor and Morning Live expert, Dr. Tharaka has these four tips and a special acronym to help cut through the haze. 1. Be kind to yourself Brain fog can happen to anyone and it's not a personal failing or a sign that you're not coping. Often, it's simply your brain's way of saying it's tired, stressed or overstretched. Remind yourself that brain fog is usually temporary and it's okay to slow down, delegate tasks or ask for help when you need it. If you are concerned then you should contact your GP. 2. Create routines Reduce decision fatigue by having a set rhythm to your days - a predictable structure can take pressure off your working memory. Knowing what's coming next stops your brain from constantly asking, ""What am I doing today?"" It's worth creating a morning and evening routine and even something as simple as laying out clothes or prepping breakfast ahead of time frees your mind from constant decision-making. 3. Take breaks Getty Images Taking some time between tasks can help reset your brain and focus It's easy to fill your diary with back-to-back commitments - meetings, social events, errands and daily tasks - without leaving any breathing room. But constantly jumping from one thing to the next can leave your brain no time to reset, making brain fog more likely. Try deliberately scheduling short breaks between activities, even just 5–10 minutes to stretch, get a drink, step outside or sit quietly. Think of these firebreaks like mental buffers: they give your mind a chance to process what you've just done, let go of lingering stress and prepare for what's next. 4. Use calendars and reminders Trying to hold every appointment, task and reminder in your head can quickly lead to mental clutter and forgetfulness. Let tech do the remembering for you - use calendars and reminders to free up mental space. Schedule recurring tasks so they happen automatically - for example, block out lunch in your diary each day or set weekly reminders for bills and chores. This means you're not constantly thinking, ""What do I need to remember next?"" Swans Getty Images Staying hydrated and eating whole foods can help clear brain fog","Brain fog, characterized by difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and mental slowness, affects many.  While not a medical condition itself, it's often linked to stress, overwork, and hormonal changes like menopause.  Dr. Tharaka, a medical expert, offers advice to combat brain fog:  Establish daily routines to reduce decision fatigue; schedule short breaks between tasks to allow mental reset; utilize calendars and reminders to minimize mental clutter; and prioritize hydration and a healthy diet.  While brain fog is often temporary, persistent concerns should prompt consultation with a GP.
","दिमागी धुंधलापन, जिसमें ध्यान केंद्रित करने में कठिनाई, भूलने की बीमारी और मानसिक सुस्ती शामिल है, कई लोगों को प्रभावित करता है। हालांकि यह अपने आप में कोई चिकित्सीय स्थिति नहीं है, यह अक्सर तनाव, अधिक काम और हार्मोनल परिवर्तन जैसे रजोनिवृत्ति से जुड़ा होता है।  डॉ. थरका, एक चिकित्सा विशेषज्ञ, दिमागी धुंधलापन से निपटने के लिए सलाह देते हैं: निर्णय थकान को कम करने के लिए दैनिक दिनचर्या स्थापित करें; मानसिक पुनर्निर्माण की अनुमति देने के लिए कार्यों के बीच छोटे ब्रेक निर्धारित करें; मानसिक अव्यवस्था को कम करने के लिए कैलेंडर और रिमाइंडर का उपयोग करें; और हाइड्रेशन और स्वस्थ आहार को प्राथमिकता दें। जबकि दिमागी धुंधलापन अक्सर अस्थायी होता है, लगातार चिंताएँ सामान्य चिकित्सक से परामर्श करने के लिए प्रेरित करनी चाहिए।

Pointless': How Lord of the Flies was rescued from the reject pile,"William Golding's novel Lord of the Flies was first published on 17 September 1954, and is now recognised as a classic. In History looks at how Golding's story of English schoolboys and their descent into barbarism narrowly escaped being thrown in the bin. ""Write what you know"" is advice often given to aspiring authors, and Lord of the Flies is a spectacular example of how clichés can still contain essential truths. A teacher at a boys' school who had witnessed first-hand the inhumanity of World War Two, William Golding condensed this knowledge and experience into his debut novel, a deceptively simple tale of shipwrecked boys reverting to savagery on a desert island. Its subversion of a familiar plot went on to resonate with generations of readers, and serve as a grim warning that the evils of Nazi Germany could be repeated anywhere. Golding was about to turn 43 when Lord of the Flies was first published. His big idea was a sinister 20th-Century reimagining of The Coral Island, RM Ballantyne's 1857 tale of derring-do in which a group of shipwrecked British schoolboys civilise a desert island, making it a playground for fun and games. Much of his original manuscript was handwritten on exercise books during school time. He even worked on the novel during lessons, while his pupils were occupied with their textbooks. A few of them were tasked with counting the number of words he'd written per page. WATCH: 'What matters to me is that there shall be a beginning, a middle and an end'. In 1953, Golding sent his novel to nine publishers, all of whom rejected it. Undaunted, he offered the manuscript to Faber and Faber, one of the most prestigious London firms. It was picked up by Charles Monteith, a junior editor who had only worked at the publishing house for a few months. The signs were not promising.","William Golding's seminal novel, *Lord of the Flies*, narrowly avoided oblivion before its publication on September 17, 1954.  Initially rejected by nine publishers, the manuscript, largely written during school hours while Golding taught, was eventually accepted by Faber and Faber.  This dark reimagining of R.M. Ballantyne's *The Coral Island* depicts the descent into savagery of British schoolboys stranded on a desert island, reflecting Golding's wartime experiences and serving as a chilling warning against the potential for barbarism.  Despite its initial struggles, *Lord of the Flies* became a critical and commercial success, establishing Golding's legacy as a major literary figure.  The novel remains a celebrated classic, continuing to resonate with readers decades after its publication.

Three and a half years later he's been released in a prisoner swap, one of eight civilians freed in a surprise move. While Russia and Ukraine have swapped military prisoners of war before, it is very rare for Russia to release Ukrainian civilians. Dmytro has been catching up frantically on all he's missed. But he's also phoning the families of every Ukrainian he met in captivity: he memorised all their names and each detail. He knows that for some, his call may be the first confirmation that their relative is alive. The welcome home There were celebrations here last month when Dmytro was returned from Russia in a group of 146 Ukrainians. A crowd came out waving blue and yellow national flags, cheering as the buses carrying the freed men passed hooting their horns. Most on board were soldiers with sunken cheeks, emaciated after their years behind bars. Officials won't say exactly how they got the eight Ukrainian civilians back in the same exchange, only that it involved sending back in return ""people Russia was interested in"". One source said those included residents of the Kursk region in Russia, evacuated when Ukrainian forces launched their 2024 incursion. The group's exact status after that is unclear. Ombudsman's Office Ukrainian officials released photos of the prisoners who finally returned home last month - including Dmytro Stepping off the bus to a cheering crowd, Dmytro's first phone call was to tell his mother he was free. Both his parents are elderly and unwell and his greatest fear had been never seeing them again. ""The hardest was not knowing when you'll be allowed back. You could be freed the next day or stay prisoner for 10 years. Nobody knows how long it's for."" Constant cruelty We met Dmytro shortly after his release as he recuperated at a Kyiv hospital. The details he shared of his captivity are chilling. ""They grabbed us and literally dragged us to the prison and on the way they beat us with rubber batons shouting things like, 'How many people have you killed?'"" he said, describing his transfer to Russia. He was held in multiple facilities and his account chimes with many others we've heard over the years. ""Sometimes they'd let the guard dog off its leash so that it could bite us. The cruelty was really shocking and it was constant."" He tells me he was bitten and left bleeding. ""I was so stressed I only felt the pain 20 minutes later."" The journalist was never charged with any crime. Francesco Tosto/BBC Dmytro managed to send one note while he was in Russian captivity, reading: ""I'm alive, I'm well. Everything's ok"" Physically the first year was the hardest. ""We were starving. We were given very little food for a long time,"" he remembers. He lost more than 20kg in the first few months, causing him dizzy spells. But the soldiers he was held with were treated far worse. ""They would call them for interrogation, and they were beaten and tortured with electric shock,"" Dmytro remembers. He heard their pain and saw the bruises. His parents' fear The journalist's family home is a world away from all that, in the pretty village of Kozarovychi just outside Kyiv. It feels peaceful, apart from the air raids, with gardens full of poultry, blackberry bushes and fruit trees. But the back wall of Dmytro's house still has chunks torn out of it by shrapnel and the lawn was only just repaired where Russian troops had parked a tank. In 2022, right at the start of their full-scale invasion when the Russians were advancing on Kyiv, they took over the village. A few days later, as Dmytro and his father, Vasyl, tried to check the damage to their home, they were detained. Francesco Tosto/BBC Halyna (left) and Vasyl (right) are Dmytro's parents - Vasyl was also briefly taken prisoner by the Russians Russian troops forced both men to the ground, bound and blindfolded them, and marched them into captivity. The pair now know they were held in a basement beneath the local warehouses where the Russians had made their base. The men were moved several times as the number of civilian detainees increased. Vasyl was eventually set free but for many months he feared the worst for his son. ""I didn't know where he'd been taken and I was scared,"" the pensioner tells me. ""There were gunshots at night. One man was taken outside, then a shot was fired. He didn't come back. I still don't know the fate of all the people who were there."" Then he and his wife got a tiny scrap of paper from a Russian prison. ""I'm alive, I'm well. Everything's ok,"" Dmytro wrote to them both, in Ukrainian. They would receive just one more note in his entire time in captivity. Ukraine's missing Other families have had no news at all. Across Ukraine, officials say more than 16,000 civilians are currently missing. So far, they've only located a fraction of them in Russian prisons. Moscow doesn't publish lists because detaining civilians with no cause is illegal. But that makes getting them back extremely complicated. Forty-three men are still being held from the area around Dmytro's village alone. They include Volodymyr Loburets, detained at the same time, held in the same basements and then moved to Russia. He now has a new grandson he's never met and a family who miss him badly. ""It's hard. It's really hard. We smile, yes, and thank goodness, I have a new grandson,"" Volodymyr's wife Vera says, as baby Yaroslav gurgles beside her on a play mat. ""But I had a husband – and now I don't."" ""The government says it won't swap our relatives for Russian soldiers, so we are left waiting for the fourth year running until there is some way to get them back."" Francesco Tosto/BBC Vera's husband Volodymyr remains in Russian captivity Vera is deeply frustrated. But so is Ukraine's human rights ombudsman. Dmytro Lubinets describes dealing with Russia as like playing chess: you stick to all the rules, only for your opponent to stand up, pull on boxing gloves and punch you. The problem is, Ukraine can't hit back. It has no pool of Russian civilian prisoners because it's against the rules of war under the Geneva Convention. Sending Russian soldiers back in return for Ukrainian civilians would be a disaster. ""The very next day Russia would take thousands of civilians hostage in occupied areas, just to swap for its soldiers,"" the ombudsman points out. ""So Russia is capturing our civilians and there is no legal mechanism to return them."" There has been one trade involving Ukrainian citizens detained and sentenced here for collaborating with the enemy: a group – said to be volunteers – was swapped for Ukrainian civilians held in Russia. It's not clear whether that has been repeated. Lasting damage","Ukrainian journalist Dmytro Khyliuk, detained in Mariupol during the initial days of the 2022 Russian invasion, was released after three and a half years in captivity as part of a prisoner exchange involving the US.  His release is highly unusual, as Russia rarely releases Ukrainian civilians.  While in captivity, Khyliuk endured beatings, starvation, and was held in multiple facilities, never facing charges. He diligently memorized details of fellow captives' stories, contacting their families upon his release to share news of their survival.  The exchange involved releasing ""people Russia was interested in,"" possibly residents of the Kursk region evacuated from Ukrainian incursions.  Khyliuk's release was celebrated in Ukraine, but the fate of other Ukrainian civilians held in Russia remains uncertain, highlighting the complexities and ethical dilemmas of prisoner swaps in a war zone.  The Ukrainian ombudsman describes negotiations with Russia as unfairly one-sided, lacking legal mechanisms to secure the return of Ukrainian civilians held without charges.  Thousands of Ukrainian civilians remain missing.

After nine hours of cooking, the effort was almost thrown into jeopardy after the giant pot used to make the dish broke as it was being hoisted onto a crane to be weighed - thankfully, none of the rice was spilled. Guinness World Records (GWR) confirmed the achievement on social media, saying Ms Baci's concoction of the popular West African dish weighed in at a staggering 8,780kg. Nigerian chef Hilda Baci has broken the world record for cooking the largest ever pot of jollof rice in Lagos last week. Despite the massive pot buckling twice during its weigh-in, a member of Baci's team told the BBC last week they were collecting evidence from different cameras to send to GWR so it could be officially recognised. Baci paid tribute to the ""tireless team"" that made the achievement possible and shared a video of her reacting to the news on social media. ""This Guinness World Record was built on unity, love, and collective strength,"" she wrote. ""We made history together, for Nigeria, for Africa, and for everyone who believes in the power of food to bring us closer this win is yours too."" Baci's recipe for the crowning jollof dish included 4,000kg of rice, 500 cartons of tomato paste, 600kg of onions and 168kg of goat meat - all poured into a custom-made pot that can hold 23,000 litres. Last week, thousands of people had gathered to watch Baci's latest world record bid - in 2023 she held the title for the longest cooking marathon at nearly four days. Their support was well rewarded as the mammoth dish later divided into individual portions and distributed to the huge crowd and passersby. The chef previously told BBC Pidgin that it took her a year to plan how she would tackle the mammoth challenge. ""We [Nigerians] are the giant of Africa, and jollof is a food that everybody knows Africans for,"" she said. ""It would make sense if we had the biggest pot of jollof rice, it would be nice for the country."" She was assisted by 10 other chefs in red uniforms wielding long wooden spoons to stir the food. Manufacturing the giant steel vessel to hold her dish took a team of 300 people two months to make but one of its legs gave way at the crucial time. Jollof rice is a staple in several West African countries, featuring rice simmered in a tomato sauce, often paired with meat or seafood. Baci won a competition for her version of jollof rice in 2021, and then became a national sensation in 2023 when she claimed the world cooking marathon record - an exhausting 93 hours and 11 minutes. However, she was later surpassed by Irish chef Alan Fisher. The current record-holder is Evette Quoibia from Australia, with 140 hours and 11 minutes, according to GWR.","Nigerian chef Hilda Baci has set a new Guinness World Record for the largest jollof rice dish, weighing in at a staggering 8,780kg.  The feat, achieved after nine hours of cooking, involved a massive pot that buckled twice during the weighing process, though the rice remained intact.  Baci, who previously held the record for the longest cooking marathon,  credited her ""tireless team"" and expressed that the record ""belongs to all of us.""  The enormous dish, made with 4,000kg of rice, 500 cartons of tomato paste, and other ingredients, was later distributed to the watching crowd.  The creation of the giant cooking vessel itself took a team of 300 two months to complete.  Baci's achievement celebrates jollof rice, a staple across West Africa, and highlights Nigerian culinary prowess.

Asking meaningful questions,"The right questions can help us connect with strangers – and create closer bonds between parents and children. In 2024, a team of psychologists at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands tested a deceptively simple idea: could being asked 14 specially designed questions by their parents help children feel more loved? The experiment was based on some well-evidenced psychological insights: as the researchers pointed out in their paper, feeling loved by their parents is known to be ""critical for children's health and well-being."" Finding ways to nurture that feeling could therefore potentially benefit families in many ways. Previous experiments with adults by other researchers had suggested that asking the right questions can help people feel closer to each other. Known as the ""fast-friends procedure"", this process gained global attention far beyond research departments some years ago after a journalist tested the questions on a romantic date. In its classic format, the fast-friends procedure involves pairs of adults asking each other profound, thought-provoking, personal questions such as: ""If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future or anything else, what would you want to know?"" This encourages the participants to reveal more about their innermost feelings, which can foster a sense of connection. In adults, the procedure has been successfully replicated in many different contexts. But would it work for the bond between parents and children?","A University of Amsterdam study explored whether asking children 14 specific questions could strengthen their bond with parents.  Building on research showing that open-ended questions foster connection (the ""fast-friends procedure,"" popularized after a journalist used it on a date), researchers investigated if this approach could improve children's feelings of parental love.  The study hypothesized that increased feelings of parental love are crucial for children's well-being. While previous research focused on adult relationships, this study examined the impact on parent-child dynamics, suggesting a potential new method for strengthening family bonds.

The country's market watchdog did not give details of how Nvidia had breached the rules, but said it would continue to investigate the matter. Nvidia said it complied with the law ""in all respects"" and will continue to cooperate with ""all relevant government agencies"". The news came as US and Chinese officials held a second day of trade talks in Spain on Monday in the latest attempt to end a trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Following the talks, US President Donald Trump hinted that a deal had been reached with China to avert a US ban on TikTok. The social media app was facing a ban in America unless it found a US buyer. The US-China trade talks in Spain were led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng. Following the talks, Mr Bessent said: ""We had very good discussions. We preferred to keep the discussions on TikTok, we will be holding trade negotiations in about a month again at a different location."" Top level trade delegations from Beijing and Washington last met in July, when they struck a deal to extend their tariffs truce by another 90 days until 10 November. The tariffs truce between China and the US cut import taxes that had reached more than 100% on each other's goods. China launched an investigation into Nvidia in December last year which was seen as the latest retaliation in a battle between the US and China over the semiconductor chip market. The US had been tightening restrictions on sales of certain exports to Chinese companies, including high-end semiconductors. The talks in Madrid were expected to address the issue of what chips, including those made by Nvidia, would be allowed to enter China. Nvidia said in a statement: ""We will continue to cooperate with all relevant government agencies as they evaluate the impact of export controls on competition in the commercial markets."" Reuters China-US trade talks, headed by China's He Lifeng and Scott Bessent of the US, started on Sunday After initially calling for TikTok to be banned during his first term, Trump has reversed his stance on the popular video-sharing app and delayed the ban three times so far. Posting on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said a deal was ""reached on a 'certain' company that young people in our country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. The relationship remains a very strong one!!!"" There had been expectations that the deadline, which was due to expire on Wednesday, might be extended for a fourth time. Although Trump was highly critical of TikTok during his first term in the White House, he softened his position after he gained popularity on the app during the 2024 presidential election.","China's market regulator has launched an anti-monopoly investigation into US chipmaker Nvidia, citing unspecified violations of Chinese law.  Nvidia maintains it is fully compliant and will cooperate with the investigation.  This action comes amid ongoing US-China trade talks in Spain, where officials discussed various trade issues, including a potential deal averting a US ban on TikTok.  While US President Trump hinted at a TikTok agreement, details remain scarce.  The Nvidia investigation is seen as a potential countermove to US restrictions on semiconductor exports to China.  The trade talks aim to address broader trade tensions and the future of chip sales to China.

But changing consumer habits saw that industry decline massively in the mid-20th century. Now, the plant is being looked at as a tool to restore soil health and even help decarbonise manufacturing. And it may be a potential diversification route for smaller farms, as demand grows for sustainable fibres. Flax farmer Helen Keys says ""there is a real resurgence and interest now in natural fibres"" Helen Keys and her sculptor husband Charlie Mallon began growing flax when they couldn't source Irish linen bags for Charlie's artwork. The crop was grown on Charlie's family farm in County Tyrone in the past. Helen's eyes have been opened to the plant's potential. ""There is a real resurgence and interest now in natural fibres because we have to look at how we are going to replace things like carbon fibre, fibreglass,"" she said. ""And natural fibres have a big role to play in decarbonizing industry."" Fibre crops like flax and hemp have a high nutrient uptake from the soil and a minimal requirement for fertiliser. They are rotational crops, which can be alternated with other arables like vegetables. Prof Mark Emmerson, from QUB, is optimistic about the potential of different applications of flax For Professor Mark Emmerson, from the School of Biological Sciences at Queen's University Belfast, that means they could play a part in tackling the blue-green algae problem in Lough Neagh by reducing the nutrient burden on the land. ""I would see flax production and veg production as part of a just transition that enables farmers to look at what they're doing on the farm and where it's appropriate - and only where it's appropriate - to look at putting an acre or two, or a hectare or two, of land under flax or veg production."" While he is realistic, he is also optimistic about the potential of different applications of flax. ""I'm not sure this is a solution for the big dairy farms,"" he said. ""But of the 26,000 farms in Northern Ireland, 78% of them are considered very small, which means that they have less than one person working the farm on any given week and those individuals are having to go off-farm to maintain a second job to maintain the farm. ""So, you know, an acre of flax in the mix might actually enable those farmers to stay on farm and work the farm so that the farm is able to pay for itself."" Kathy Kirwan says ""nothing goes to waste"" with flax A community gathering - a meitheal, in ancient Irish tradition - was held at the end of August, bringing volunteers from around the island of Ireland to Helen and Charlie's farm near Cookstown to finish the flax harvest. Self-confessed ""flax nut"" Kathy Kirwan travelled from Clonakilty in County Cork to take part. She has fallen in love with the ""circular"" nature of the plant. ""Nothing goes to waste, absolutely nothing. Like, 50% of the plant when you're processing it comes out as shives (woody material) and that's used for composite. ""We made paper, so no part of it actually goes to waste whatsoever. ""It just fits into the values of protecting the earth, protecting nature, and it needs no pesticides or herbicides."" Malú Colorín, Fibreshed Ireland, says there are ""so many things you can do with"" flax She has worked with Malú Colorín, from Fibreshed Ireland, which is part of a global movement that focuses on regenerative fashion using locally grown fibres. ""Linen is kind of like the cream of the crop of what you can do with flax, but then you can also create less fine fibres, such as rope as well,"" she said. ""And then of course, if you get into the shive, the by-product, you can get into composites and oil from the seeds and wax and stuff."" Crafter Cathy Kane says flax is ""perfect"" Crafter Cathy Kane and her husband are working to build their own self-sustainable homestead in North Cork. Where they live is called Sliabh Luachra, which translated from Irish means rushy mountain. ""It's very agrarian agriculture, forestry, that kind of thing, so flax is perfectly suited. ""Flax is part of my crop rotation in my sort of vegetable garden rotation that I'm kind of planning in my head. ""And because I like working with fibre, I thought it's perfect."" Gawain Morrison organises the Flax Meitheal weekend","Northern Ireland's flax industry, once a global powerhouse, is experiencing a resurgence.  Driven by growing demand for sustainable materials and a renewed focus on soil health, flax farming is attracting interest from small-scale farmers seeking diversification.  The plant's versatility is key; its fiber is used in linen production, while the woody shives find use in composites, and seeds yield oil.  Experts highlight flax's potential in decarbonizing manufacturing, reducing reliance on materials like carbon fiber and fiberglass, and improving soil health, even potentially mitigating blue-green algae in Lough Neagh.  This revival is not only economically beneficial for farmers but also aligns with environmentally conscious consumer trends, fostering a more sustainable and circular economy.  Events like the Flax Meitheal showcase this renewed interest and the potential for flax to play a significant role in Northern Ireland's agricultural future.

Google's president and chief investment officer Ruth Porat told BBC News in an exclusive interview there were ""profound opportunities in the UK"" for its ""pioneering work in advanced science"". The money will be used for infrastructure and scientific research over the next two years - the first of several massive US investments being unveiled ahead of US President Donald Trump's state visit. She pointed to the government's AI Opportunities Action Plan as helping the investment, but said ""there's still work to be done to land that"", and that capturing the upside of the AI boom ""was not a foregone conclusion"". Ms Porat said there was ""now a US-UK special technology relationship... there's downside risks that we need to work on together to mitigate, but there's also tremendous opportunity in economic growth, in social services, advancing science"". The investment will expand this site and also include funding for London-based DeepMind, run by British Nobel Prize winner Sir Demis Hassabis, which deploys AI to revolutionise advanced scientific research. What is AI, how does it work and why are some people concerned about it? Donald Trump's UK state visit is this week - here's what we know Google's owner Alphabet has become the fourth company to be worth more than $3 trillion in terms of total stock market value The US administration had pressed the UK to water down its Digital Services Tax on companies, including Google, in talks this year, but it is not expected to feature in this week's announcements. Further multi-billion-dollar UK investments are expected from US giants over the next 24 hours. The pound has strengthened, analysts say, partly on expectations of interest rate changes and a flow of US investment. On Monday, Google's owner Alphabet became the fourth company to be worth more than $3 trillion in terms of total stock market value, joining other technology giants Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple. Google's share price has surged in the past month after US courts decided not to order the breakup of the company. Google CEO Sundar Pichai had succeeded in making the company an ""AI First"" business, with Ms Porat saying, ""it's that performance which has resulted in that metric"". Until this summer, Google had been seen to have lagged behind startups such as OpenAI, despite having pioneered much of the key research behind large language models. Across the world, there has been some concern about the energy use and environmental impact of data centres. Ms Porat said that the facility would be air-cooled rather than water-cooled and the heat ""captured and redeployed to heat schools and homes"". Google has also signed a deal with Shell to supply ""95% carbon-free energy"" for its UK investments. In the US, the Trump administration has suggested that the power needs of AI data centres require a return to the use of carbon-intensive energy sources. Ms Porat said that Google remained committed to building renewable energy, but ""obviously wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine every hour of the day"". Energy efficiency was being built into ""all aspects of AI"" microchips, models, and data centres, but it was important to ""modernise the grid"" to balance off periods of excess capacity, she said. Asked about fears of an AI-induced graduate jobs crisis, Ms Porat also said that her company was ""spending a lot of time"" focused on the AI jobs challenge. ""It would be naive to assume that there isn't a downside. If companies just use AI to find efficiencies, we're not going to see the upside to the UK economy or any economy."" But, she said, entire new industries were being created, opening new doors, and in jobs such as nursing and radiology, adding: ""AI is collaborating with people rather than replacing them. ""Each one of us needs to start using AI so you can understand how it can be an assistance to what you're doing, as opposed to actually fearing it and watching from the sidelines,"" she said.","Google's parent company, Alphabet, announced a £5 billion investment in UK AI infrastructure and research over the next two years, coinciding with President Trump's state visit.  This includes the official opening of a $1 billion data center in Waltham Cross and funding for DeepMind, the London-based AI research firm.  The investment, fueled by Alphabet's recent surge in stock value, is part of a wave of anticipated US investment in the UK, potentially boosting the British pound.  While highlighting the UK government's AI strategy as a contributing factor, Google acknowledged the potential downsides of AI, including job displacement and environmental concerns.  To address these, Google emphasized its commitment to sustainable energy, using air-cooling and partnerships with energy providers to minimize its carbon footprint, and its focus on mitigating potential job losses through retraining and the creation of new AI-related industries.  The investment reflects a growing ""US-UK special technology relationship,"" but also underscores the need for collaborative efforts to manage the risks associated with the rapid advancement of AI.

Andy May, from Dersingham, Norfolk, who was jailed for stealing £1.3m from his employer to fund an online gambling addiction, said he was concerned about the increase in the arcades, some of which operate 24 hours a day. ""It's like an unstoppable flood at the moment,"" said Mr May, who now works as a recovery coach for other problem gamblers. British Amusement Catering Trades Association (Bacta), which represents owners of gaming centres, said they were ""among the safest places to gamble"". Paul Moseley/BBC Machines offer jackpots of up to £500 from a maximum stake of £2 a spin There are nearly 1,500 adult-only gaming centres in Britain, where players can spend up to £2 per spin to win jackpots of up to £500. The charity GambleAware has warned that more are opening in deprived parts of the country where, it said, people are ""two times more likely to experience gambling harms"". Getty Images The number of adult gaming centres in high streets has increased significantly in recent years King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council recently called for more powers from the government to regulate adult gaming centres. (ACGs) There are three in King's Lynn town centre – no further than 320m (1,049ft) apart – with a fourth due to open. Mr May, who is now working with Reframe Coaching - a charity which supports problem gamblers - said he was concerned about the effect they could have. ""Money is a big thing around that but there's also a whole load of other mental health impacts that come off the back of that gambling harm,"" he said. ""Relationship breakdowns, potentially job losses – if people are bunking off work to go in the AGC – there could be consequences. ""They seem to be cropping up without any control around them."" Mark Arnull (Reform UK leader of West Northants Council), Jess Asato (Labour MP for Lowestoft) and James Wild (Conservative MP for North West Norfolk) in the BBC Politics East studio discussed gaming centres Councils have little control when it comes to licensing venues because of the 2005 Gambling Act. It requires them to approve gambling licences where the minimum criteria is met, regardless of local community opposition. King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council has joined other local authorities in calling for stronger powers when determining such licences. Earlier this month, the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the government was planning to introduce ""cumulative impact assessments, like those already in place for alcohol licensing"". ""We will give councils stronger powers over the location and numbers of gambling outlets to help create safe, thriving high streets,"" he told the House of Commons. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is backing more regulation over gambling centres Bacta president Joseph Cullis denied that AGC operators ""deliberately target disadvantaged areas"" and said they ""tend to open on high streets where there is already footfall"". ""They are among the safest places to gamble, with experienced staff on hand to identify problems and provide support to customers. ""Our members operate within one of the most tightly regulated licensing regimes in the world,"" he added. ""'Aim to permit' does not mean automatic approval – it means councils must assess applications fairly against the licensing objectives in an open, transparent and consultative way, ensuring all sides can be heard."" Jess Asato MP (Labour, Lowestoft) welcomed the government's plan to look at the effect of gambling venues. ""I don't want to see these gambling places proliferating on my high street,"" she said. James Wild MP (Conservative, North West Norfolk) said: ""I want to see local authorities given powers to look at the cumulative impact. We put it in our white paper on gambling before the election."" The Reform UK West Northamptonshire Council leader Mark Arnull said councils needed more powers. ""We have limited powers under the planning law as to where we can restrict the number of these [gaming centres] coming in,"" he said. ""It defies logic that you fund organisations to help gambling addiction but can't stop the core problem [too many gaming venues].""

May, who had stolen £1.3 million to fund his addiction, now works as a recovery coach and warned that these centres, some operating 24 hours, could harm both mental health and relationships. There are nearly 1,500 AGCs in Britain, offering jackpots of up to £500 from a maximum £2 stake. The charity GambleAware highlighted that more AGCs are opening in deprived areas, where people are more likely to experience gambling issues.

Local councils, including King's Lynn and West Norfolk Borough Council, have little control over these venues because of the 2005 Gambling Act, which requires councils to approve licenses if basic criteria are met, even if there’s local opposition. This has led to calls for stronger powers, including ""cumulative impact assessments"" for gambling venues, a proposal supported by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. The industry body Bacta defended AGCs, stating they are highly regulated and safe places to gamble. Politicians across parties, including Jess Asato (Labour) and James Wild (Conservative), have backed calls for more regulation to ensure the gambling industry does not harm communities.","एक रिकवर हो रहे जुआ आदी, एंडी मे, ने यूके की हाई स्ट्रीटों पर बढ़ती वयस्क गेमिंग सेंटरों (AGCs) की संख्या पर चिंता व्यक्त की, खासकर उन क्षेत्रों में जो पहले से जुआ से होने वाली समस्याओं से प्रभावित हैं। मे, जिन्होंने अपनी लत को फंड करने के लिए £1.3 मिलियन चोरी किया था, अब एक रिकवरी कोच के रूप में काम करते हैं और चेतावनी देते हैं कि ये सेंटर, जिनमें से कुछ 24 घंटे चलते हैं, मानसिक स्वास्थ्य और रिश्तों को नुकसान पहुंचा सकते हैं। ब्रिटेन में लगभग 1,500 AGCs हैं, जो अधिकतम £2 की बाजी से £500 तक के जैकपॉट प्रदान करते हैं। चैरिटी GambleAware ने यह चेतावनी दी है कि और भी AGCs गरीब क्षेत्रों में खुल रहे हैं, जहां लोग जुआ से जुड़ी समस्याओं का अधिक सामना करते हैं।

Shortly before, his Venezuelan counterpart Nicolás Maduro said Caracas would defend itself against US ""aggression"", calling America's top diplomat Marco Rubio the ""lord of death and war"". Trump said on Monday that three men were killed in the attack on ""violent drug trafficking cartels"". He provided no evidence that the boat was carrying drugs. President Donald Trump says the US military has destroyed an alleged Venezuelan drug vessel travelling in international waters on the way to the US. ""This morning, on my orders, US military forces conducted a second kinetic strike against positively identified, extraordinarily violent drug trafficking cartels and narcoterrorists,"" Trump said on Truth Social. ""These extremely violent drug trafficking cartels pose a threat to US national security."" The post also included a nearly 30 second video, which appeared to show a vessel in a body of water exploding and then bursting into flames. Speaking later from the Oval Office, Trump said that the US had recorded proof and evidence that the boats belonged to narco-terrorist groups. ""All you have to do is look at the cargo - it was spattered all over the ocean - big bags of cocaine and fentanyl all over the place,"" he said. ""We recorded them. It was very careful, because we know you people would be after us. We're very careful."" Trump went on to assert that drug trafficking to the US by sea had decreased under recent efforts, but acknowledged that narcotics were still entering the country by land. ""We're telling the cartels right now, we're going to be stopping them too,"" he said. Rubio had earlier on Monday defended the first attack on a boat said to be carrying drugs from Venezuela, which killed all 11 people on board, saying Washington had ""100% fidelity and certainty"" that the vessel was involved in trafficking to the US. ""What needs to start happening is some of these boats need to get blown up,"" he said during an interview on Fox News. He added that Maduro represented ""a direct threat to the national security"" of the US due to his alleged involvement in drug trafficking. Later on Monday, Maduro said that relations with the US had ""been destroyed by their bomb threats"". ""We have moved from a period of battered relations to a completely broken one"". The Venezuelan president said the government would ""fully"" exercise its ""legitimate right to defend itself"". Legal experts previously told the BBC that the fatal strike on the first vessel in international waters may have violated international human rights and maritime law. Asked by a journalist on Sunday whether the US would now ""start doing strikes on mainland Venezuela"", Trump answered: ""We'll see what happens."" Speaking to reporters in New Jersey, the president said Venezuela was ""sending us their gang members, their drug dealers and drugs"". He said that maritime traffic in the southern Caribbean had reduced significantly ""since the first strike"". Experts raised questions about the legality of the 2 September attack on the alleged drug boat, saying that it may have violated international law. Venezuela responded by flying two F-16 fighter jets over a US Navy destroyer two days later. That led Trump to warn that any Venezuelan jets putting ""us in a dangerous situation"" would be shot down. After a brief lull, tensions rose again on Saturday when Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yván Gil accused US forces of boarding a Venezuelan vessel. Gil said the vessel, which he described as a ""small, harmless"" fishing boat, was seized ""illegally and hostilely"" for eight hours.","Tensions between the US and Venezuela escalated after the US military destroyed an alleged Venezuelan drug boat in international waters, killing three people. The attack, ordered by President Donald Trump, was part of a counter-narcotics operation targeting violent drug trafficking cartels. Trump posted a video showing the boat exploding and said it was linked to narcoterrorist groups, though he provided no evidence that the boat was carrying drugs. Trump also claimed the US had recorded proof of the drugs, including cocaine and fentanyl, scattered in the ocean.

Earlier, US Senator Marco Rubio defended an earlier strike on another alleged drug boat from Venezuela, which killed all 11 people aboard. Rubio called the strike necessary to counter the threat posed by Venezuela’s government, which he said was involved in drug trafficking. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro condemned the US actions as ""aggression"" and said Venezuela had the right to defend itself. Maduro also criticized US relations, stating that they had been ""destroyed"" by threats and military actions.

Legal experts raised concerns that the US strike on the Venezuelan vessel may have violated international maritime and human rights laws. The US had previously deployed warships to the southern Caribbean for counter-narcotics operations, and tensions increased further when Venezuelan jets flew over a US Navy destroyer. Trump warned that any Venezuelan planes creating a dangerous situation would be shot down.","अमेरिका और वेनेजुएला के बीच तनाव उस समय बढ़ गया जब अमेरिकी सैन्य बलों ने अंतरराष्ट्रीय जलक्षेत्र में एक alleged वेनेजुएलन ड्रग बोट को नष्ट कर दिया, जिसमें तीन लोग मारे गए। यह हमला, जिसे राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रम्प के आदेश पर अंजाम दिया गया, एक काउंटर-नारकोटिक्स ऑपरेशन का हिस्सा था, जिसका उद्देश्य हिंसक ड्रग तस्करी कार्टेल्स को निशाना बनाना था। ट्रम्प ने एक वीडियो पोस्ट किया, जिसमें बोट को विस्फोटित होते हुए दिखाया गया और कहा कि यह नारको-आतंकवादी समूहों से जुड़ा था, हालांकि उन्होंने कोई प्रमाण नहीं दिया कि बोट में नशीले पदार्थ थे। ट्रम्प ने यह भी दावा किया कि अमेरिका ने ड्रग्स, जैसे कोकीन और फेंटानाइल, के प्रमाण रिकॉर्ड किए हैं, जो समुद्र में फैले हुए थे।

पहले, अमेरिकी सीनेटर मार्को रुबियो ने वेनेजुएला से आए एक अन्य ड्रग बोट पर किए गए हमले का बचाव किया, जिसमें 11 लोग मारे गए थे। रुबियो ने इस हमले को आवश्यक बताया, क्योंकि उनके अनुसार वेनेजुएला सरकार ड्रग तस्करी में शामिल थी। वेनेजुएला के राष्ट्रपति निकोलस मादुरो ने अमेरिकी कार्रवाई को ""आक्रमण"" कहा और कहा कि वेनेजुएला को अपनी रक्षा का पूर्ण अधिकार है। मादुरो ने अमेरिकी संबंधों की आलोचना करते हुए कहा कि ये ""धमकियों और सैन्य कार्रवाइयों"" से ""विनष्ट"" हो गए हैं।

Cyber criminals have stolen the private details of potentially millions of Balenciaga, Gucci and Alexander McQueen customers in an attack. The firm also says it has emailed customers affected but has not said how many, or made any public statements about the hack. Legally, the company is not obligated to make any public statements about the breach as long as it has notified all individuals affected through other means. The cyber criminal behind the attack calls themselves Shiny Hunters. They claim to have data linked to 7.4m unique email addresses which suggests the total number of individual victims could be similar. A small sample shared with the BBC as proof contained thousands of customer details which appear to be genuine. Once analysed the files were deleted. One of the details in the stolen data is ""Total Sales"" which shows how much money a person has spent with each brand. Some customers are shown to have spent more than $10,000 with a handful spending $30,000-$86,000 in stores in the small sample analysed by the BBC. This information is particularly concerning for victims as it could lead to high spenders being targeted by secondary hacks and scams if the hacker decides to leak the information to other criminals. Shiny Hunters appears to be acting alone and told the BBC over Telegram chat that they breached the luxury brands in April through Kering. The hacker contacted the French company in early June and claims to have been in on-off negotiations with them over a ransom to be paid in Bitcoin. This is denied by the company which says it has not engaged in any conversations with the criminal. The company says it has refused to pay the hacker in accordance with long-standing law enforcement advice.

No financial information - such as bank account numbers, credit card information, or government-issued identification numbers - was involved in the incident,"" a Kering spokesperson said adding it has since secured its IT systems. The data breach which happened in April came at the time of a wave of attacks on luxury brands including Cartier and Louis Vuitton also disclosed breaches to customers and the public. It's not known if those attacks are linked to Shiny Hunters. In June, cyber security experts at Google issued a warning about a trend of attacks linked to Shiny Hunters that the tech giant also subsequently fell victim to.

Some customers were shown to have spent over $10,000, with a few spending up to $86,000.

Shiny Hunters reportedly breached Kering’s systems in April and later contacted the company demanding a ransom in Bitcoin, which Kering denied and refused to pay, following law enforcement advice. The company has since secured its systems and notified affected customers, although it has not disclosed the number publicly. The breach coincides with a wave of similar attacks on other luxury brands like Cartier and Louis Vuitton, with possible connections to Shiny Hunters. Google cybersecurity experts have also warned about attacks by the same group, known as UNC6040, which uses phishing tactics to steal employee login credentials.","लक्ज़री ब्रांड्स गुच्ची, बालेन्सियागा और अलेक्जेंडर मैकक्वीन के ग्राहकों की निजी जानकारी हैकर्स ने चुरा ली है। इस हैक में नाम, ईमेल, फोन नंबर, पते और खरीदी गई कुल राशि जैसी जानकारी लीक हुई है। पेरेंट कंपनी केरिंग ने इस घटना की पुष्टि की है लेकिन बताया कि कोई वित्तीय जानकारी जैसे क्रेडिट कार्ड विवरण चोरी नहीं हुआ है। इस हमले के पीछे साइबर अपराधी समूह शाइनी हंटर्स है, जो दावा करता है कि उनके पास 7.4 मिलियन ईमेल पते जुड़े हुए डेटा हैं, जिससे संभावित पीड़ितों की संख्या करोड़ों हो सकती है। कुछ ग्राहकों ने $10,000 से अधिक खर्च किया है, जबकि कुछ ने $86,000 तक की खरीदारी की है।

This was the result 4 hours ago Share Save Kristian Johnson and Kate Berry BBC News Share Save BBC Elizabeth can spend up to four hours a night in her room watching YouTube videos A group of teenagers from Bradford, the 2025 UK City of Culture, agreed to take all technology out of their bedrooms for five days to see how they would cope. We followed two of them, Elizabeth and Henry, to capture the highs and lows - and to see how long they lasted before giving in to temptation. Thirteen-year-old Elizabeth says she rarely spends time with her parents after school. The self-confessed Sabrina Carpenter fan normally heads straight to her bedroom for ""three or four hours"" to watch YouTube videos of her pop idol and chat to her friends. ""My bedroom is basically my peace place,"" she says. But she is one of four teenagers at her secondary school to sign up to a tech-free bedroom challenge. It's all part of this year's Teen Summit, a project from Radio 5 Live and BBC Bitesize Study Support. The annual event explores issues affecting teenagers, from smartphones to social media and knife crime to misinformation. The teenagers will still be able to use their tech, including phones, tablets and laptops - but only in the communal areas of the house. ""It's going to be hard,"" says Elizabeth. ""I'm someone who likes to be in my room."" Elizabeth's dad, Robin, thinks she will ""crack before the end of the week"" and take her phone into her bedroom. ""That's going to be a challenge for her,"" he says as Elizabeth starts to laugh. He's so confident, in fact, that he's made a bet with his daughter. ""If she cracks, Dad gets a big bag of wine gums."" Elizabeth (centre) made a bet with her parents that she would be able to last five full days without any technology in her bedroom Other students at Elizabeth's West Yorkshire school are also taking part in the project, including 15-year-old Eliza, who says the lack of private space to talk to friends is on her mind. ""I plan on making it as inconvenient as possible for [my family],"" she says, describing her plan to spend time in shared family spaces, such as ""on the stairs"" and ""on the sofa, but where they want to sit"". Michelle, 15, plans to ""read a book to fall asleep"", instead of staying up on her phone and laptop. She says usually a normal night's sleep can be as little as ""five hours, max"". Henry, 13, spends most of his time at home gaming with his friends online until nine or 10 at night. However ""the latest I've stayed up is probably about 2am,"" he says sheepishly. ""There's sometimes where I'll be gaming that I forget to even drink water."" Watch: 'I've signed up to give up all my tech in my bedroom' In July, new rules come into force as part of the Online Safety Act to try and make the internet safer for young people. Children's commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza says while these changes are ""welcome and long overdue"", parents should set boundaries for their children by ""introducing phone-free time or unplugging before bed to promote better rest and wellbeing"". An online survey of two thousand 13- to 18-year-olds, conducted for BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Bitesize by Survation, suggests 38% of the teens who identify as gamers spend seven or more hours per week gaming in their bedroom. One in 10 boys spend more than 20 hours a week in their room away from their family. Henry stored his PlayStation in a cupboard at the start of the week to try and avoid temptation, but it only stayed there for ""about two hours"" before being put into the living room. It's a space where his mum, Alyson, often spends her evenings too, with Henry having to remind his friends to not swear when they're speaking on their headsets. Although he says it means he can't ""speak as freely"" with his friends, Alyson says it has helped to ""open up the conversation"" between the pair. It has also made her realise how much of Henry's friendships are built around online gaming. ""That's the biggest part. It's not really about playing the games, it's the social aspect."" He says another bonus of leaving his tech outside his bedroom at night has meant he hasn't got caught up watching ""billions of videos"" on TikTok just before he goes to sleep. Henry says he is already sleeping much better, which in turn has ""helped in school… in all subjects and all aspects"". 'Teens still need lots of sleep' Henry usually spends several hours a day in his bedroom gaming with his friends online Improved sleep quality is something Dr Kaitlyn Regehr, associate prof in digital humanities at University College London, says she would expect the teens to experience after removing digital devices from their rooms. ""There are increasing reports of teens feeling tired during the school day because of their smartphone usage,"" she says. She adds that teens ""still need lots of sleep"", which can be disrupted by overnight notifications or late-night exposure to blue light through smartphone screens. Reflecting on Henry and Elizabeth's gaming, Dr Regehr says basic safety checks parents can do include checking if a teen knows exactly who it is they are gaming with, not having geo-locators turned on, and making sure the themes within the game are age-appropriate. The teenagers were given analogue alarm clocks throughout the week-long experiment By Wednesday, Elizabeth says she has found other unexpected benefits and has spent her evenings researching ballet lessons and baking chocolate chip bread ""out of boredom"". ""If I still had my tech, I would have procrastinated baking [until] next week,"" she says. Her parents, Robin and Grace, say they've also noticed a change, with Elizabeth choosing to watch documentaries on the family TV rather than online videos in her room. ""[The project has] given her an idea that there's other things to do besides going on your mobile phone and your computer,"" says Robin. 'A lot better than sitting at home' As the project comes to an end, the four teenagers swap stories of their tech-free week. Michelle says she almost gave up on the challenge multiple times as she would like ""some peace and quiet"", while Eliza says being in a ""really bad mood"" with her family meant she went to the cinema with her friends. ""It was really fun actually… a lot better than sitting at home,"" she says. ""I wouldn't normally do that stuff, mainly opting to stay on my phone after school."" But what about the book Michelle planned to read through the week? ""I think I read one chapter, that's it,"" she says, adding ""the reality is it's not going to happen"". Screen time isn't monitored by a quarter of parents In a survey of 2,224 13 to 18-year-olds, conducted for BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Bitesize, young people were asked about various aspects of life - including their smartphone habits, gaming and screen time. The findings of the survey, carried out by polling company Survation, suggest: More than a third (38%) of teenagers said they spent five or more hours on their phones on an average day. 39% would consider taking tech and screens out of their bedrooms to reduce time spent on their devices Other ways to minimise time on their devices include using in-built settings such as screen time caps (59%) or scheduling regular screen time breaks (66%) 25% say their parents set clear limits on how much time they spend on tech, gaming or social media, while 47% say their parents sometimes set limits However, more than a quarter (27%) say their parents don't set any limits Back at home, Henry gleefully rips the 'tech free zone' sign off his bedroom door and instantly moves his PlayStation back onto his desk, but he says he will continue with some new habits he has picked up throughout the week. ""I'll keep my phone outside my bedroom at night because that has helped so much with my sleep."" ""I'm really proud,"" says his mum, Alyson. ""He's done really well."" Elizabeth's dad Robin is similarly impressed with his daughter's resilience - but it does mean he lost his bet. ""A deal's a deal,"" he says as he hands over two packets of sweets. ""Well done.""","For a BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Bitesize project, four teenagers in Bradford participated in a five-day tech-free bedroom challenge.  The experiment, part of the annual Teen Summit addressing issues facing youth, aimed to explore the impact of technology on sleep, social interaction, and overall well-being.  Participants, including Elizabeth and Henry, initially struggled, with Henry's PlayStation briefly returning to his room.  However, the challenge yielded positive results: improved sleep, increased family interaction, and unexpected activities like baking and researching ballet for Elizabeth.  While some participants, like Michelle, found maintaining the tech-free environment difficult,  the overall experience prompted reflection on technology overuse and its consequences.  The project highlighted the significant amount of time teenagers spend on screens – a recent survey showed 38% spend five or more hours daily on their phones – and underscored the need for parents to set boundaries and promote healthier technology habits, particularly before bedtime.  The teens' experiences and expert commentary emphasized the importance of adequate sleep for adolescent development.
","BBC रेडियो 5 लाइव और BBC Bitesize के एक प्रोजेक्ट के तहत, ब्रैडफोर्ड के चार किशोरों ने पांच दिन के लिए टेक-फ्री बेडरूम चैलेंज में भाग लिया। यह प्रयोग, जो कि हर साल आयोजित होने वाले Teen Summit का हिस्सा था, युवाओं के सामने आने वाली समस्याओं को समझने के लिए था और इसका उद्देश्य प्रौद्योगिकी के प्रभाव को नींद, सामाजिक इंटरैक्शन और समग्र स्वास्थ्य पर जानना था।

भागीदारों में एलीज़ाबेथ और हेनरी ने शुरुआत में संघर्ष किया, जहां हेनरी का प्लेस्टेशन कुछ समय के लिए वापस उसके कमरे में आ गया। हालांकि, इस चुनौती ने सकारात्मक परिणाम दिए: बेहतर नींद, बढ़ी हुई पारिवारिक इंटरएक्शन, और एलीज़ाबेथ द्वारा बैले पर रिसर्च करना और बेकिंग जैसी अप्रत्याशित गतिविधियाँ। कुछ प्रतिभागियों जैसे मिशेल के लिए टेक-फ्री वातावरण बनाए रखना मुश्किल था, लेकिन कुल मिलाकर यह अनुभव प्रौद्योगिकी के अत्यधिक उपयोग और इसके परिणामों पर विचार करने के लिए प्रेरित करता है।

इस प्रोजेक्ट ने किशोरों द्वारा स्क्रीन पर बिताए गए समय की महत्वपूर्ण मात्रा को उजागर किया – हाल की एक सर्वेक्षण में पाया गया कि 38% किशोर रोज़ाना पांच या उससे अधिक घंटे अपने फोन पर बिताते हैं। इसने यह भी जोर दिया कि माता-पिता को सीमाएँ निर्धारित करने और विशेष रूप से सोने के समय से पहले स्वस्थ प्रौद्योगिकी की आदतों को बढ़ावा देने की आवश्यकता है। किशोरों के अनुभव और विशेषज्ञों की टिप्पणी ने किशोरों के विकास के लिए पर्याप्त नींद के महत्व को उजागर किया।",en,[],,Elizabeth and Henry are among those ditching technology in their bedrooms to see how they cope.,[''],www.bbc.com_sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This year's big winners of the night were HBO's medical drama The Pitt, Apple TV+'s Hollywood satire The Studio and Netflix's chilling psychological miniseries Adolescence. Tramell Tillman made history as the first black man ever to win an Emmy for supporting actor in a drama series. The Late Show host Stephen Colbert pulled off a big win after his fellow nominees in the talk show category rallied behind him following his show's abrupt cancellation. And awards night host Nate Bargatze implored winners to keep their long-winded speeches snappy with a running gag that saw his charity donation docked if speech-givers went over their allotted time. Here's a look at this year's big moments from the ceremony at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles. Adolescence sweeps its category Getty Images Stephen Graham and Jack Thorne's drama about a 13-year-old boy accused of murder dominated the miniseries category with wins for best series and for stars Owen Cooper and supporting actress Erin Doherty. Cooper, 15, made Emmys history as the youngest supporting actor to win his category, and delivered a heart-warming acceptance speech after giving presenter Sydney Sweeney a shy hug. ""It means so much to me, my family, people back home. So, you know, it's just, yeah, it just means a lot to me,"" Cooper said backstage after his win. Backstage, director Philip Barantini told reporters that they made the show in Yorkshire with the hope it would ""spark a bit of a conversation in the UK"" where knife crime has become a big issue, but added he could not have predicted its global success. The Studio wins big Getty Images The Studio actors Dewayne Perkins, Keyla Monterroso Mejia, Kathryn Hahn, Chase Sui Wonders, Seth Rogen, Ike Barinholtz and Bryan Cranston The Hollywood satire Seth Rogen co-created and stars in picked up several awards, completing an impressive run in its first season. Rogen, who arrived backstage unable to carry all the trophies he had acquired, joked: it's ""getting embarrassing"". Alas, he did not thank his fictional right-hand man Sal Saperstein in his acceptance speech. The Pitt bests Severance Getty Images Katherine LaNasa and Noah Wyle at the 77th Primetime Emmy Awards It came down to Severance's battle of the mind and The Pitt's battle of the heart in the best drama series category, with HBO's medical drama besting the top nominee. The Pitt took home two major Emmy awards in a row, winning outstanding drama series and Noah Wyle winning best lead actor in a drama series, who called his win ""a dream"". ""I want to dedicate this, on behalf of everyone, to all the healthcare workers, front-line first responders. Respect them, protect them, trust them,"" show creator R Scott Gemmill said while accepting the award for best drama. Before that, Katherine LaNasa also won the award for best supporting drama actress for her portrayal of a charge nurse, Dana, in the show. Host Nate Bargatze keeps speeches in check with a cheque Getty Images Emmys host Nate Bargatze kept a running tally of donations to the Boys and Girls Club of North America throughout the show First-time host Nate Bargatze, known for his family-friendly humour, knocked it out of the park with his idea to keep winner speeches short: He started off the night with a $100,000 (£73,630) pledge to the Boys and Girls Club of North America that would be docked $1,000 for every second someone went over. ""It's hard. It's tough. It's brutal. I can't change it. This is a game I made up and these are the rules,"" he said in his opening monologue after explaining the idea. The ""game"" ran throughout the telecast, with most winners ignoring it or promising to make up for how much money they lost the club. The check-ins throughout the night made for a consistent running gag. The Studio star Seth Rogen kicked off the speeches and kept it speedy due to his shock at the win, adding another $6,000 to the roster. But his successor, The Pitt star Katherine LaNasa greatly overran, and had what Bargatze called ""a very expensive wave"" that lost the club several thousands of dollars. During a mid-show check-in the total was down to -$26,000 and Bargatze quipped that he's ""actually making money"". But with Hollywood's love of a happy ending, Bargatze closed the show by pledging $250,000 and that network CBS would add on another $100,000. Severance's Trammell Tillman makes Emmys history Getty Images Severance star Tramell Tillman, who plays the enigmatic Seth Milchick in Apple TV+'s mind-bending drama, became the first black man ever to win an Emmy for supporting actor in a drama series in the award show's 77-year history. During his speech, Tillman dedicated the award to his mother, whom he described as his first acting coach. Speaking to reporters after the show, he also thanked the black actors nominated in the category before him, including Andre Braugher, Ossie Davis and Michael K Williams. He said his character is a man that is aware of his race and place ""in the world of Lumon"" and was proud that he was able to ""elevate his story"" and ""practice authenticity"" on the show. Despite show being axed, a gracious Colbert thanks CBS Getty Images Colbert, whose late-night chat show The Late Show was cancelled by CBS earlier this year, offered up his vintage headshot and made a public plea for work when he took the stage as a presenter early in the telecast. He also received a standing ovation and rapturous chants of ""Stephen, Stephen!"" ""I want to thank CBS for giving us the privilege of being part of the late night tradition, which I hope continues long after we're no longer doing this show,"" he said when he won the prize for outstanding talk series. Backstage, Colbert said he didn't yet have plans for his next big move, just that he was eager to get back to work on Tuesday. Hannah Einbinder speaks up about Gaza war Getty Images Hannah Einbinder of Hacks","The 77th Primetime Emmy Awards saw HBO's ""The Pitt"" win Outstanding Drama Series, along with awards for Lead Actor (Noah Wyle) and Supporting Actress (Katherine LaNasa).  Apple TV+'s ""The Studio,"" a Seth Rogen-led satire, also garnered multiple awards, with Rogen jokingly overwhelmed by the number of trophies.  Netflix's ""Adolescence"" dominated the miniseries categories, with 15-year-old Cooper becoming the youngest-ever supporting actor winner.  A historic win went to Trammell Tillman (""Severance""), the first Black man to win a Supporting Actor Emmy in a drama series.  Host Nate Bargatze implemented a unique fundraising challenge, donating $100,000 to the Boys & Girls Club and ultimately raising over $350,000 through a system of penalties and bonuses for speech lengths.  Despite his show's cancellation, Stephen Colbert received a standing ovation and thanked CBS.  Hannah Einbinder of ""Hacks"" used her acceptance speech to comment on the Gaza war.

The anniversary season will also feature Johnny Vegas, Lucy Beaumont, and Shobna Gulati in Jim Cartwright’s play Road, with veteran actor Sir Tom Courtenay returning in a pre-recorded segment.

Threlfall has had a distinguished career on stage and screen, winning an Olivier Award in 1980 and earning two Tony Award nominations. He previously appeared in King Lear as Edgar opposite Sir Laurence Olivier in a 1983 TV version filmed in Manchester. His upcoming performance in the title role will be staged in September and October 2026.","डेविड थ्रेलफॉल, जिन्हें चैनल 4 की Shameless में फ्रैंक गैलाघर का किरदार निभाने के लिए जाना जाता है, अगले साल मैनचेस्टर के मंच पर लौटते हुए शेक्सपीयर की मशहूर रचना किंग लियर का मुख्य किरदार निभाने जा रहे हैं। 71 वर्षीय यह अभिनेता रॉयल एक्सचेंज थिएटर की 50वीं वर्षगांठ (2026) के अवसर पर इस प्रतिष्ठित भूमिका में नजर आएंगे।

थ्रेलफॉल 1980 और 90 के दशक में रॉयल एक्सचेंज के नियमित कलाकार रहे हैं और मैकबेथ जैसी नाटकों में भी अभिनय कर चुके हैं। 1999 के बाद से उन्होंने वहां काम नहीं किया, क्योंकि उनका एक आर्टिस्टिक डायरेक्टर से मतभेद हो गया था। इस विशेष सीज़न में जॉनी वेगास, लूसी ब्यूमोंट और शोभना गुलाटी भी जिम कार्टराइट के नाटक रोड में दिखाई देंगे, जबकि वरिष्ठ अभिनेता सर टॉम कोर्टने प्री-रिकॉर्डेड सेगमेंट में वापसी करेंगे।

थ्रेलफॉल का करियर मंच और स्क्रीन दोनों पर बेहद सफल रहा है। उन्होंने 1980 में ऑलिवियर अवॉर्ड जीता और दो बार टोनी अवॉर्ड नामांकन हासिल किया। वे पहले भी किंग लियर में नज़र आ चुके हैं—1983 की टीवी प्रस्तुति में उन्होंने सर लॉरेंस ओलिवियर के साथ एडगर की भूमिका निभाई थी। उनका नया किंग लियर प्रदर्शन सितंबर और अक्टूबर 2026 में होगा।",en,[],,Actor David Threlfall was a regular at the Royal Exchange theatre in Manchester in the 1980s and 90s.,[''],www.bbc.com_sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Australians are already living with the consequences of climate change today,"" Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen said, ""but it's clear every degree of warming we prevent now will help future generations avoid the worst impacts in years to come."" The report looked at three global warming scenarios - above 1.5C, above 2C and above 3C. Australia - one of the world's biggest polluters per capita - has already reached warming of above 1.5C, the report said, noting that at 3C, heat-related deaths in Sydney may rise by more than 400% and almost triple in Melbourne. The 72-page report - released days before the government announces its emissions reduction targets for 2035 - found that no Australian community will be immune from climate risks that will be ""cascading, compounding and concurrent"". It warned of more heatwave-related deaths, poorer water quality due to severe flooding and bushfires, and a A$611bn ($406bn; £300bn) drop in property values. By 2050, the report found the number of coastal communities located in ""high and very high risk areas"" in Australia will increase and if populations levels remain stable, this will mean more than 1.5 million people will be at risk. Areas in northern Australia, along with remote communities and outer suburbs of major cities, were particularly at risk, the report said. ""This will put pressure on health, critical infrastructure, natural species and ecosystems, and primary industries,"" the report warned, as well as posing extra challenges for emergency responders. The report also found that coral reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland and Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia - both already hit by record bleaching events - will face higher risks of ""bleaching and biodiversity loss"" due to warmer oceans.","A landmark climate risk report warns that by 2050, rising sea levels will threaten over 1.5 million Australians living in coastal areas.

But investors rely on regular reports for transparency. Less frequent reporting, Trump argued, would ""save money, and allow managers to focus on properly running their companies"". In a Truth Social post, Trump urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to shift away from requiring firms to report on a quarterly basis and instead adopt a semi-annual schedule. US President Donald Trump is pushing regulators to loosen reporting requirements for public companies, echoing his efforts to end quarterly earnings reports during his first term in the White House. The US has required public companies to report earnings every three months since 1970. Any effort to scale back the frequency of those reports is likely to face opposition from shareholders and other critics, who argue that the shift could threaten transparency and risk market volatility. Trump had also called on the SEC to adopt semi-annual reporting during his first term, though his proposal failed to materialise. The regulator's current leadership, including chair Paul Atkins, has been critical of disclosures that companies consider to be a burden. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a sign of growing momentum behind Trump's proposal, the Long-Term Stock Exchange, a stock trading venue, said last week that it intended to ask the SEC to allow companies to report results twice a year instead of quarterly, the Wall Street Journal reported. Veteran investor Warren Buffett and JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon have questioned the benefits of quarterly financial guidance, specifically, warning that a focus on short-term profits comes at the expense of long-term strategy. In his post on Monday, Trump suggested that China's reporting requirements for public companies were business-friendly, compared to those in the US. ""Did you ever hear the statement that, 'China has a 50 to 100 year view on management of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis???' Not good!!!"", Trump wrote. Allowing companies to report every six months would put the US more closely in line with practices in the UK and several countries in the European Union.","US President Donald Trump has renewed his call to end quarterly earnings reports for public companies, urging the SEC to adopt a semi-annual reporting system instead. He argued that less frequent reports would save money and let managers focus on long-term strategy.

The US has required quarterly reporting since 1970, and critics warn that reducing frequency could harm transparency and increase market volatility. Still, some business leaders like Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon have criticized the obsession with short-term profits driven by quarterly guidance.

Recently, the Long-Term Stock Exchange expressed support for Trump’s proposal, signaling growing momentum. Trump also compared US rules to China’s and Europe’s, claiming those systems are more business-friendly.","अमेरिकी राष्ट्रपति डोनाल्ड ट्रंप ने सार्वजनिक कंपनियों के लिए त्रैमासिक रिपोर्टिंग (हर तीन महीने) समाप्त करने और इसकी जगह छमाही रिपोर्टिंग लागू करने की मांग फिर से उठाई है। उनका तर्क है कि इससे कंपनियों का पैसा बचेगा और प्रबंधन अल्पकालिक मुनाफे के बजाय दीर्घकालिक रणनीति पर ध्यान दे सकेगा।

अमेरिका में 1970 से तिमाही रिपोर्टिंग अनिवार्य है। आलोचकों का कहना है कि रिपोर्टिंग की आवृत्ति कम करने से पारदर्शिता घटेगी और बाज़ार में अस्थिरता बढ़ सकती है। हालांकि वॉरेन बफेट और जेपी मॉर्गन के सीईओ जेमी डाइमोन जैसे निवेशक पहले ही तिमाही मार्गदर्शन की आलोचना कर चुके हैं, क्योंकि यह कंपनियों को अल्पकालिक लाभ पर केंद्रित करता है।

Lane got to know Duplantis when he coached his brother Andreas, who was also a pole vaulter for LSU. “One of the things that makes Mondo so good is that he’s a coach of himself,” he says. “Mondo always had insight into Andreas’ vaulting. “He understands the event very, very well.” It helped having a pole-vault pit in the back yard of their home in Louisiana, where Duplantis grew up alongside his two brothers and younger sister Johanna, who is also a professional pole vaulter. “My brothers and I would jump in the back yard - it was our playground,” says Johanna. “Our dad introduced us to the pole vault. We just fell in love with it - a kind of domino effect.” Greg Duplantis is a former elite pole vaulter. He and wife Helena - a Swedish former heptathlete and volleyball player - coach their son, who competes for Sweden. “One memory is just jumping in the back yard after school and Mondo would coach me,” says Johanna. “There’s this video of him coaching me, and he was just like: ‘That was terrible!’ I was literally in my school uniform! “There’s a lot of memories in that back yard that I will cherish forever.” The same goes for Duplantis himself. Speaking to BBC podcast The Warm Up Track in 2019, he recalled watching his brother and friends in action. “When I was seven years old, I saw them bending the pole and I couldn’t because I was light as a feather,” he says. “I told my dad I wanted to bend the pole, so we asked UCS Spirit to make me some special poles. They were just about as flimsy as a fishing pole. ""That’s how I started - right in my back yard.” Hours of practising in that yard soon brought results. Mondo holds multiple international age-group records:","Mondo Duplantis’ pole vault journey began in his backyard, where he practiced with his siblings. His father Greg, a former vaulter, and mother Helena, a former athlete, coached him. Even as a child, Mondo had a deep understanding of the sport and often coached his siblings. Using custom poles, he mastered the technique early and went on to break records. His family and training environment laid the foundation for his successful career.","मोंडो डुप्लांटिस की पोल वॉल्टिंग यात्रा बचपन से ही शुरू हुई। उनके घर के पिछवाड़े में पोल-वॉल्ट पिट था, जहाँ वह अपने भाइयों-बहनों के साथ अभ्यास करते थे। पिता ग्रेग (पूर्व वॉल्टर) और माँ हेलेना (पूर्व खिलाड़ी) ने उन्हें मार्गदर्शन दिया। मोंडो कम उम्र से ही खेल को गहराई से समझते थे और अपने भाई-बहनों को भी कोच करते थे। विशेष पोल से अभ्यास करते हुए उन्होंने बचपन में ही तकनीक सीखी और रिकॉर्ड तोड़े। परिवार और माहौल ने उनके करियर की मजबूत नींव रखी।",en,[],,,[''],www.bbc.com_sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The framework was set in talks in Madrid, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Monday, adding that President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping would ""complete"" the deal on Friday. Trump said on Truth Social that the talks had ""gone very well"". China confirmed a framework agreement but said no deal would be made at the expense of their firms' interests. A Wednesday deadline looms for TikTok's Chinese owner to find a buyer for US operations or face a ban in the country over national security concerns. The deadline for a sale has since been extended three times already and the latest delay is due to end on 17 September. The BBC's US partner CBS reported late on Monday that Oracle was among a group of firms that would enable TikTok operations to continue in the US if a deal between Washington and Beijing is finalised. The BBC has contacted Oracle, TikTok, the White House and the Chinese embassy in Washington DC for comment. The ownership of TikTok has been a major sticking point in US-China trade talks. It was seen by observers as key to Beijing's efforts to negotiate lower tariffs and fewer trade barriers with the US, one of China's biggest markets. Bessent announced the ""framework"" deal after the second day of negotiations to end a trade war which, at its peak, saw tariffs on some goods hit145%. The agreed upon commercial terms would protect US national security interests, he added. US trade representative Jamieson Greer, part of the delegation in Madrid, said the deal struck was ""subject to the leaders' approval"", but added his team was ""not... in the business of having repetitive [ban] extensions"". China's top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, said his country would not reach a deal with the US at the expense of its own principles and its leadership would review any deal before it was agreed.

The US Justice Department has said TikTok's access to data on American users poses ""a national-security threat of immense depth and scale"". But ByteDance has repeatedly insisted that its US operations are fully independent and no data has been shared with the Chinese government. The company also argued that the ban would violate free speech protections for its 170 million US users.

The hashtag #Dubaiportapotty, which has been viewed more than 450 million times on TikTok, links to parodies and speculative exposés of women accused of being money-hungry influencers secretly funding their lifestyles by fulfilling the most excessive of sexual requests.

Monic thought the job in Dubai was going to be in a supermarket, according to her sister Rita. ""He [Mr Mwesigwa] was violent when I told him I wanted to go back home,"" says Mia, who also knew Monic in Dubai. She says that, when she first arrived, he told her she already owed him £2,000 ($2,711) and that within two weeks that debt had doubled. ""Money for air tickets, for your visa, for where you're sleeping, food,"" says Mia. ""That means you have to work hard, hard, hard, pleading for men to come and sleep [with] you."" Monic owed Mr Mwesigwa more than $27,000 (£19,918) after several weeks, according to what a relative of hers we are calling Michael says she told him. He adds that he received tearful voice notes from her. Family handout Monic grew up with 10 siblings in rural Uganda Mia told us that clients were mostly white Europeans, and included men with extreme fetishes. ""There's this one client, he poops on girls. He poops and he tells them to eat the shit,"" she explained quietly. Another woman we are calling Lexi, who says she was tricked by a different network, echoed Mia's story, saying ""porta potty"" requests were frequent. ""There was a client who said: 'We pay you 15,000 Arab Emirates Dirham ($4,084, £3,013) to gang-rape you, pee in your face, beat you, and add in 5,000 ($1,361, £1,004)'"" for being recorded eating faeces. Her experiences have led her to believe there is a racial element to this extreme fetish. ""Every time I said that I wouldn't want to do that, it seemed to get them more interested. They want somebody who is going to cry and scream and run. And that somebody [in their eyes] should be a black person."" Lexi says she tried to get help from the only people she thought could intervene - the police. But she says they told her: ""You Africans cause problems for each other. We don't want to get involved. And they would hang up."" We put this allegation to the Dubai police and they did not reply. Lexi eventually escaped back to Uganda and now helps to rescue and support women in similar situations. Warsan Tower in Dubai, from which Monic Karungi fell in May 2022 Finding Charles Mwesigwa wasn't easy. We could only find one picture of him online - and it was taken from behind. He also uses multiple names across social media. But through a combination of open-source intelligence, undercover research, and information from a former member of his network, we traced him to a middle class neighbourhood in Dubai - Jumeirah Village Circle. To corroborate what sources had told us about his business - supplying women for degrading sex acts - we sent in an undercover reporter posing as an event organiser sourcing women for high-end parties. Mr Mwesigwa appeared calm and confident when speaking about his business. Mr Mwesigwa showed us his UK driving licence and said he was a former London bus driver ""We've got like 25 girls,"" he said. ""Many are open-minded… they can do pretty much everything."" He explained the cost - from $1,000 (£738) per girl per night, but more for ""crazy stuff"". He invited our reporter for a ""sample night"". When asked about ""Dubai porta potty"" he replied: ""I've told you, they are open-minded. When I say open-minded… I will send you the craziest I have."" In the course of the conversation, Mr Mwesigwa said he used to be a London bus driver. We have seen evidence he put that occupation down on an official document in east London in 2006. He went on to tell our reporter that he loved this business. ""I could win the lottery, a million pounds, but I would still do it… it's become part of me."" Troy, a man who says he used to act as operations manager for Mr Mwesigwa's network, gave us more information about how he says it is run. Troy says he used to work as a driver and then an operations manager for Charles Mwesigwa He says Mr Mwesigwa pays off security at various nightclubs so they will let his women in to find clients. ""I've heard about types of sex that I've never seen in my life. It doesn't matter what you go through as long as his rich men are happy… [the women] have no escape route…They see musicians, they see footballers, they see presidents."" Mr Mwesigwa has been able to get away with running this operation, Troy claims, because Troy and others are not just used as drivers. He says their names are also used by Mr Mwesigwa to hire cars and apartments, so that his own name never appears on the paperwork. On 27 April 2022, Monic posted a selfie from Al Barsha - a residential neighbourhood popular with expats in Dubai. Four days later, she was dead. She had been in the emirate for just four months. According to Mia, Monic and Mr Mwesigwa had been regularly arguing in the period before she left. Mia says Monic had been refusing to comply with Mr Mwesigwa's demands and had found a way out of his network. ""She had got some kind of job. She was very excited. She thought she was gonna get free, she was going to get her life back because now that was a real job, no sleeping with men,"" Mia says. Monic moved out to a different apartment about 10 minutes' walk away. It was from this apartment's balcony that she fell on 1 May 2022. Instagram The final selfie Monic posted before she died Monic's relative Michael, who was in the UAE at the time she died, says he tried to get answers. Police told him they stopped their investigation, having found drugs and alcohol in the apartment Monic had fallen from, and only her fingerprints on the balcony, he says. He obtained a death certificate for Monic from a hospital, but it did not say how she had died. And her family were unable to obtain a toxicology report for her. But a Ghanaian man living in the apartment building was more helpful, he says, taking him to another block to meet the man he said was Monic's boss. Michael describes the scene when he got there and saw where the women were housed. He says through the cloud of shisha smoke in the living room, he made out what looked like cocaine on the table and women having sex on chairs with clients. He claims he found the man we had previously identified as Charles Mwesigwa in bed with two women, and that when he tried to drag him to the police Mr Mwesigwa replied: ""I have spent 25 years in Dubai. Dubai is mine… There is no way you are going to report me… Embassy is me, I'm the embassy. ""[Monic's] not the first to die. And she won't be the last,"" he added, according to Michael. Mia and Keira both independently say they witnessed this conversation and both confirm its wording. When we asked Mr Mwesigwa what he meant by this, he denied having said it. Monic's death shares haunting similarities with that of Kayla Birungi, another Ugandan woman who lived in the same neighbourhood as her, and died in 2021 after falling from a Dubai high-rise apartment which we have evidence to suggest was managed by Charles Mwesigwa. The phone number for her landlord, shared with us by Kayla's family, turned out to be one of Mr Mwesigwa's numbers. Troy also confirms that Mr Mwesigwa managed the apartment, as do four other women we spoke to for this investigation. Instagram Kayla Birungi, another Ugandan, also died after falling from a Dubai high-rise building Kayla's relatives say that they - like Monic's family - heard Kayla's death had been linked to alcohol and drugs. But a toxicology report seen by the BBC shows none were present in her system at the time of her death. While Kayla's family was able to repatriate her body and hold a burial, Monic's remains were never returned. Our investigation found she was likely buried in a section of Dubai's Al Qusais Cemetery known as ""The Unknown"". It features rows and rows of unmarked graves, typically thought to belong to migrants whose family couldn't repatriate their bodies. Monic and Kayla were part of a wider, unofficial pipeline connecting Uganda to the Gulf. As Uganda wrestles with rising youth unemployment, moving to work abroad - mainly in the Gulf states - has become a huge industry that contributes $1.2bn (£885m) of tax revenue to the country each year. But these opportunities can carry a risk. Mariam Mwiza, a Ugandan activist against exploitation, says she has helped rescue more than 700 people from around the Gulf. ""We get cases of people who have been promised to work, let's say, in a supermarket. Then [that person] ends up sold as a prostitute,"" she told us. Monic's family in rural Uganda say Monic always had the ambition to seek a better life","BBC investigations have uncovered Charles Mwesigwa, running a sex-trafficking network in Dubai's upscale neighborhoods, exploiting vulnerable Ugandan women under false pretenses. Women were lured with promises of regular jobs but forced into degrading sex work, with extreme fetishes imposed by wealthy clients. Two women, Monic Karungi and Kayla Birungi, died under suspicious circumstances after falling from apartments linked to Mwesigwa's network. Victims report abuse, debt bondage, and lack of legal support, highlighting the dark reality of human trafficking in the Gulf and the exploitation of migrant women seeking better opportunities. Activists have rescued hundreds, but many remain trapped.","बीबीसी की जांच में सामने आया कि चार्ल्स म्वेसिग्वा दुबई के आलीशान इलाकों में एक सेक्स-ट्रैफिकिंग नेटवर्क चला रहा था, जिसमें कमजोर युगांडा की महिलाओं का शोषण किया जा रहा था। महिलाओं को सामान्य नौकरी का वादा कर बुलाया गया, लेकिन उन्हें अपमानजनक सेक्स वर्क में मजबूर किया गया, और अमीर ग्राहकों की अत्यधिक मांगें पूरी करनी पड़ीं। मोनिक करुंगी और कायला बिरुंगी जैसी दो महिलाओं की संदिग्ध परिस्थितियों में मौत हुई, जो म्वेसिग्वा के नेटवर्क से जुड़ी अपार्टमेंट्स से गिर गई थीं। पीड़ितों ने शोषण, कर्ज में फंसा देना और कानूनी मदद की कमी की शिकायत की। यह मामले खाड़ी में मानव तस्करी और प्रवासी महिलाओं के शोषण की गंभीर वास्तविकता को उजागर करते हैं। सक्रिय कार्यकर्ता अब तक सैकड़ों महिलाओं को बचा चुके हैं, लेकिन कई अभी भी फंसी हुई हैं।",en,[],,Young Ugandan women tell BBC they are being lured to Dubai to take part in extreme sex acts.,[''],www.bbc.com_sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In his first comments since sacking Lord Mandelson, Sir Keir said the Labour peer went through a proper due diligence process before his appointment, but he added: ""Had I known then what I know now, I'd have never appointed him."" Sir Keir gave public backing to Lord Mandelson in the Commons on Wednesday only to sack him the following day. Opposition MPs will get a chance to put further pressure on the government after the Speaker granted the Tories an emergency debate on the appointment on Tuesday. Emails reported by Bloomberg showed supportive messages Lord Mandelson sent to Epstein in 2008 following his guilty plea. The leaked emails included passages in which Lord Mandelson told Epstein to ""fight for early release"" shortly before he was sentenced to 18 months in prison. He is also reported to have told Epstein ""I think the world of you"" the day before the disgraced financier began his sentence for soliciting prostitution from a minor in June 2008. Speaking to reporters, Sir Keir said the messages showed Lord Mandelson ""was not only questioning but wanting to challenge the conviction of Epstein at the time"". Lord Mandelson's emails ""cut across the whole approach that I've taken on violence against women and girls for many years and this government's"", he added. The emails showed ""the nature and extent of the relationship that Peter Mandelson had with Epstein was far different to what I had understood to be the position when I appointed him."" Sir Keir added he was ""not at all"" satisfied with Lord Mandelson's responses to questions ""put to him by government officials"". The prime minister has faced questions about his judgment in appointing the peer, whose friendship with Epstein was public knowledge, in the first place. Sir Keir insisted he did not know what was in the emails when he defended the US ambassador at Prime Minister's Questions but said he knew Foreign Office officials had asked Lord Mandelson questions about the email. The scandal, coming so soon after Angela Rayner's resignation as deputy prime minister, has encouraged some Labour MPs to become more vocal about their frustrations with the prime minister's leadership and the wider Downing Street operation. On Monday Sir Keir faced a further blow, when one of his senior aides, Paul Ovenden, resigned after the leaking of explicit messages about veteran MP Diane Abbott from eight years ago. The debate in Parliament could prove damaging for Sir Keir's efforts to draw a line under the scandal ahead of US President Donald Trump's state visit this week, and the Labour conference at the end of the month. Labour MPs are expressing public and private frustration with the prime minister's leadership. The Foreign Affairs Committee, chaired by Labour MP Dame Emily Thornberry, has demanded the government give evidence on how Lord Mandelson was cleared and appointed. Labour backbencher Richard Burgon told Radio 4's Today programme Sir Keir would be ""gone"" if May's elections in Scotland, Wales and parts of England go badly for Labour. The Conservatives have also demanded the prime minister release documents relating to Mandelson's appointment. In the letter to the prime minister, Tory MP Alex Burghart questioned what and when Sir Keir knew of Mandelson's friendship with Epstein before defending the former ambassador during Prime Minister's Questions last Wednesday.","UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he would never have appointed Peter Mandelson as US ambassador had he known the full extent of Mandelson’s links with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Emails revealed Mandelson had supported Epstein’s early release and expressed admiration for him, which conflicted with Starmer’s stance on violence against women and girls. The scandal has intensified scrutiny of Starmer’s judgment and leadership, especially after recent resignations of senior aides and ongoing parliamentary pressure from both Labour and Conservative MPs.","यूके के प्रधानमंत्री सायर कीर स्टारमर ने कहा कि अगर उन्हें पीटर मंडेलसन के दोषी पेडोफाइल जेफ्री एपस्टीन के साथ संबंधों की पूरी जानकारी होती, तो वे उन्हें अमेरिका का राजदूत नियुक्त नहीं करते। लीक हुई ईमेल में मंडेलसन ने एपस्टीन की जल्दी रिहाई का समर्थन किया और उनके प्रति प्रशंसा व्यक्त की, जो महिलाओं और लड़कियों के खिलाफ हिंसा के खिलाफ स्टारमर के दृष्टिकोण के विपरीत था। इस घोटाले ने स्टारमर की निर्णय क्षमता और नेतृत्व पर बढ़ता दबाव पैदा किया है, खासकर वरिष्ठ सहायकों के हालिया इस्तीफों और संसद में दोनों, लेबर और कंज़र्वेटिव सांसदों के सवालों के बाद।",en,[],,The PM says a due diligence process was gone through before Lord Mandelson was appointed US ambassador.,[''],www.bbc.com_sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Narendra Shrestha wants to know who will take responsibility for the death of his son Sulov, who was among scores killed in violent unrest that rocked Nepal last week. Mr Shrestha, 45, is perched outside the gates of Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital's mortuary in the capital. He's already been inside and identified 21-year-old Sulov's body. ""I want to ask this country,"" he says, choking back tears, ""if they can fire, they can shoot my son, then I and his mother, will also stand. Who will we live for now? We also want to die."" A female family member sits beside him, holding his hand, while a man protects him from the beating sun with an umbrella. Other families were also waiting to identify their young loved ones whose lives were cut short: one had dreamed of being a judge, another was a student working in a Kathmandu hotel, a third was learning French. They are among more than 70 people who died in anti-corruption protests at the start of last week, which toppled the government of the Himalayan nation. More than 1,000 were injured in the two days of unrest. Pritam Roy Narendra Shrestha says his son was shot in the head: ""Who will we live for now?"" A ban on social media was the impetus for the protests, but anger against government corruption had been building in recent weeks. By the time the ban was reversed late on Monday, 8 September, the protests had swelled into a wider movement. Crowds torched politicians' homes and official buildings as an outpouring of anger at the ruling class boiled over. Many of those killed were shot - police are accused of opening fire on the crowds. But others were burned in fires or died in confrontations with police. Casualty figures have been going up as authorities clean up the debris. In response to the allegations, Nepal's police have said they will investigate what happened during those two days of violent protests. It's still unclear who gave the orders for security forces to open fire. Family handout There are several families like Mr Shrestha's waiting outside the mortuary for their names to be called so they can identify the bodies. One man, Rasik KC, is waiting for the body of his 22-year-old nephew, Rashik Khatiwada. Rashik was shot twice in the chest, Mr KC says. He found out about the death after seeing clips on social media. His anguish has now turned to anger, demanding some kind of accountability from the government. ""We want justice,"" he says.

The relatives of Subash Bohora, 21, said there was a time in his life when he wanted to be a judge. He died outside Nepal's parliament building after a bullet pierced his neck. Ayush Thapa, 19, was a French language student who was interested in the British Army and hated Nepali politicians, his family says. He was shot in the chest. Abishek Chaulagain, 22, was a student working in one of the capital's hotels when he was shot in the forehead. ""We had never come across a disaster like this,"" says Ranjana Nepal, an information officer at the Civil Service Hospital in Kathmandu. She says they treated more than 450 patients in their emergency room during the protests. Six people died. ""Our hospital [has been] in operation for 17 years. We were able to manage patients during the earthquake. [This] situation was worse."" On the first night of protests, Dr Santosh Paudel was working at Bir Hospital, not far from the parliament building. Of the 173 patients his team treated in the hospital's emergency ward, five died and four are still in critical condition. Dr Paudel says he was surprised to see patients with ""sharp rifle injuries"" in addition to rubber bullets. ""We saw [two types of bullets] clearly, the long one, which is fired by shotguns, and the small ones with the sharp edge that is fired from rifles,"" said Dr Paudel. He said many of the patients that came later in the day had multiple bullet injuries. Pritam Roy Parliament was attacked and images of it set ablaze were seen around the world Protests began last Monday when thousands heeded a call by demonstrators describing themselves as Generation Z to gather near parliament in Kathmandu over the decision to ban platforms including Facebook, X and YouTube, as well as over wider dissatisfaction with the government. Ministers said police had to use force, which included water cannons, batons and firing rubber bullets. Saying they'd failed to register locally, the government announced social media platforms needed to be regulated to tackle fake news, hate speech and online fraud. But popular platforms such as Instagram have millions of users in Nepal, who rely on them for entertainment, news and business – and protesters accused the government of trying to silence them. By Tuesday, violent crowds were setting fire to government buildings in the capital Kathmandu. Parliament was torched even though Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli had already resigned. Nepal's new interim Prime Minister, Sushila Karki has a tough road ahead. Not only does the 73-year-old former chief justice need to appoint a new cabinet, she must rebuild confidence in the country's leadership. She has agreed to fresh elections on 5 March 2026, but the first real test of her new government will be her investigation into the protests and if she can bring the perpetrators of the deadly violence – including those who shot protesters, as well as those behind the widespread vandalism – to justice. Pritam Roy ""International law says they are not allowed to shoot,"" says Abishek Shrestha, 22, from his hospital bed, his home for the next month. Metal rods protrude from the white and pink gauze wrapped around his right leg, where he was shot. ""I'm Nepali and they are not allowed to shoot me, but they shot me.

And accelerating inflation, driven in part by tariffs, could make it worse. Government data points to the early stages of businesses passing on the costs of US President Donald Trump's sweeping import tariffs to consumers. Still, inflation remains well below its peak, and a debate continues over the extent to which tariffs will lead to a sustained rise in the pace of price hikes. But Americans like Yanique Clarke are feeling the pinch. Yanique, a nursing student in Manhattan who identifies as lower-income, said while shopping for groceries at a Target store this week that ""prices are really drastically high"" for meat, vegetables and fruit. ""It's quite a while now, but it's getting higher,"" she said. And it's not just groceries. When she was recently back-to-school shopping for her 13-year-old daughter, Yanique found those prices to be ""very much higher compared to previous years"". What Yanique sees in the grocery and clothing aisles aligns with data from the Labor Department, released on Thursday. In August, prices for several tariff-exposed products ticked up: clothing prices, for instance, rose 0.5% from the previous month. Grocery prices also increased 0.6% in the month to August, with particularly strong gains for coffee, a product that is sensitive to tariffs. Economists noted that the growth in food prices, which tend to be volatile, might also be driven by the Trump administration's immigration policies, as mass deportations suppress the workforce in the food and agriculture sectors and boost labour costs. But how Americans experience the rising prices for everyday goods is far from uniform. ""Lower-income households are almost tailor-made to be exposed to tariffs,"" said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab. Mr Tedeschi was previously an economist in the Biden administration. Those with less disposable income tend to spend more of their budget on imports, Mr Tedeschi said. Moreover, the type of imports that have disproportionately borne the burden of tariffs so far this year, such as imports from China, tend to be lower-priced goods, he added. A report from the Yale Budget Lab released earlier this month found that, as of June, core goods prices were 1.9% above pre-2025 trends, suggesting that tariffs are raising prices for window coverings, appliances and electronics, among other basic products. Corporate executives are taking note of the consumer divide. McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski warned earlier this month that higher-income Americans are still able to spend freely while everyone else falters. It is part of why the chain is expanding its value menu, to entice price-conscious customers. ""Particularly, with middle and lower-income consumers, they're feeling under a lot of pressure right now,"" Mr Kempczinski said. ""It's really kind of a two-tier economy,"" he added. Danielle Kaye/BBC Nancy Garcia says ""even the supermarket has gotten really expensive"" Back at the Manhattan Target store, Nancy Garcia glanced at price tags in the clothing section. ""Now I'm doing more price comparison,"" she said. ""I'm comparing, is this on sale at the supermarket? ""But even the supermarket has gotten really expensive."" Nancy, who works in the publishing and gifts industry, said she considers herself to be middle-income. Through her work, she has heard small retailers raise concerns about tariffs affecting their bottom line. But she said it is unclear whether the supermarkets and chains where she tends to shop are raising prices because of tariffs, or if ""people are taking advantage"". Sylvia Sealy, who lives in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, was looking at the clothing racks at a discount department store in Manhattan this week, lamenting what she viewed as skyrocketing prices for everything from groceries and clothes to building materials. ""Since tariffs started, I check around for prices,"" said Sylvia, a part-time nurse who also identified as middle-income. ""If there's something in this store for $15, you could get it somewhere probably for $12. So you shop in that way more now.

Men are more likely to die from it. The paradox, revealed in a study of the country's latest cancer registry, tells a story at once simple and confounding. Women account for just over half of all new cases, but men make up the majority of deaths. India appears to be an outlier. In 2022, for every 100,000 people worldwide, on average about 197 were diagnosed with cancer that year. Men fared worse, at 212, compared to 186 for women, according to the World Cancer Research Fund. Nearly 20 million cancer cases were diagnosed globally in 2022 - about 10.3 million in men and 9.7 million in women. In the US, the estimated lifetime risk of cancer is nearly equal for men and women, according to the American Cancer Society. In India, the most common cancers among women are breast, cervical, and ovarian. Breast and cervical cancers make up 40% of female cases. While cervical cancer is largely linked to infections such as human papillomavirus (HPV), breast and ovarian cancers are often influenced by hormonal factors. Rising cases of these hormone-related cancers are also associated with lifestyle shifts - including later pregnancies, reduced breastfeeding, obesity, and sedentary habits. For men, oral, lung, and prostate cancers dominate. Tobacco drives 40% of preventable cancers, mainly oral and lung. So what is going on in India? Is it an earlier diagnosis for women? Are men's cancers more aggressive, or is it that habits such as smoking and chewing tobacco drag down their outcomes? Or does the answer lie in differences in access, awareness and treatment between genders? Gautam Bose For men, oral and lung cancers dominate - tobacco drives 40% of these cancers Awareness campaigns and improved facilities mean cancers common among women are often detected earlier. With their long latency periods - time between exposure to a cancer-causing factor and the appearance of detectable cancer - treatment outcomes are relatively good. Mortality rates among women are therefore lower. Men fare worse. Their cancers are more often tied to lifestyle - tobacco and alcohol drive lung and oral cancers, both aggressive and less responsive to treatment. Men are also less likely to go for preventive check-ups or seek medical help early. The result: higher mortality and poorer outcomes, even when incidence is lower than among women. ""Women's health has become a bigger focus in public health campaigns, and that's a double-edged sword. Greater awareness and screening mean more cancers are detected early. For men, the conversation rarely goes beyond tobacco and oral cancer,"" Ravi Mehrotra, a cancer specialist and head of the non-profit Centre for Health Innovation and Policy (CHIP) Foundation, told me. ""Women, through reproductive health checks, are more likely to see a doctor at some stage. Many men, by contrast, may go their whole lives without ever seeing one,"" Dr Mehrotra said. But the real story emerges when the numbers are broken down: India's cancer burden is unevenly spread across regions, and across the types of cancer people face. Data from 43 registries show that 11 out of every 100 people in India run the risk of developing cancer at some point during their life. An estimated 1.56 million cases and 874,000 deaths are projected for 2024. The hilly and relatively remote northeast region remains India's cancer hotspot, with Mizoram's Aizawl district recording lifetime risks twice the national average. Doctors say much of this is down to lifestyle. ""For most cancers in the north-eastern state, I'm convinced lifestyle is the key factor. Tobacco use is rampant here - much higher than elsewhere,"" R Ravi Kannan, head of Cachar Cancer Hospital and Research Centre in Assam, told me. ""In Barak Valley in Assam, it's mostly chewing tobacco; just 25km away in Mizoram, smoking dominates. Add to that alcohol, areca nuts, and even how meat is prepared. Food choices and preparation drive cancer risk. There's no special cancer-causing gene at play - hereditary cancers aren't more common here than in other parts of India,"" Dr Kannan said. But the pattern isn't confined to the northeast. Srinagar in Indian-administered Kashmir tops the charts for lung cancer in men, while southern Hyderabad city leads in breast cancer. Men in the capital, Delhi, are being diagnosed with all cancers put together at a higher rate than men in other regions, even after correcting for age differences. Oral cancer is also rising: 14 population registries report increases among men and four among women. AFP via Getty Images The hilly and relatively remote northeast region remains India's cancer hotspot","In India, more women are diagnosed with cancer, particularly breast, cervical, and ovarian cancers, due to better awareness and early detection through reproductive health checks. Men, however, die more often from cancer—mainly oral, lung, and prostate—because these cancers are aggressive, linked to tobacco and alcohol, and often detected late. Regional lifestyle factors, such as high tobacco and alcohol use in the northeast, further drive higher mortality among men despite lower incidence.","भारत में महिलाओं में कैंसर के मामले अधिक पाए जाते हैं, खासकर स्तन, ग्रीवा और अंडाशय के कैंसर, क्योंकि महिलाओं में जागरूकता और प्रजनन स्वास्थ्य जांच के जरिए जल्दी पहचान होती है। पुरुषों में हालांकि मृत्यु दर अधिक है—मुख्यतः मुंह, फेफड़े और प्रोस्टेट कैंसर में—क्योंकि ये कैंसर आक्रामक होते हैं, तंबाकू और शराब से जुड़े होते हैं, और अक्सर देर से पता चलते हैं। उत्तरी-पूर्वी क्षेत्रों में तंबाकू और शराब की अधिक खपत जैसी जीवनशैली की वजह से पुरुषों में मृत्यु दर और बढ़ जाती है।",en,[],,"Women account for just over half of all new cases, but men make up the majority of deaths.",[''],www.bbc.com_sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no suggestion that anyone consumed the contaminated broth but Haidilao had offered to pay thousands of diners who dined at the restaurant in the days following the incident. The incident, which happened in February at a Shanghai branch of China's biggest hotpot chain Haidilao, sparked widespread criticism after the 17-year-olds posted a video of their drunken act online. Two teenagers who peed into a pot of broth at a hotpot restaurant have been ordered to pay 2.2m yuan ($309,000; £227,000) to two catering companies in China. Last Friday, a Shanghai court found that the teenagers had infringed upon the companies' property rights as well as reputation through ""acts of insult"", noting that their actions contaminated tableware and ""caused strong discomfort among the public"". It also found that the teens' parents had ""failed to fulfil their duty of guardianship"" and ordered that they bear the compensation, state media reported. This includes 2m yuan for operational and reputational damage, 130,000 yuan to one of the caterers for tableware losses and cleaning expenses, and 70,000 yuan in legal costs. However the court ruled that any additional compensation Haidilao offered to its customers, beyond what they were billed, was a ""voluntary business decision"", and therefore should not be borne by the teenagers. Haidilao had offered to compensate more than 4,000 diners who visited the branch between 24 February - the date of their visit - and 8 March, both with a full refund and a cash compensation that is 10 times the amount they were billed. They also replaced all hotpot equipment and said they had conducted cleaning and disinfection works. Haidilao has expanded quickly since it opened its first restaurant in Jianyang in Sichuan province. It now operates more than 1,000 restaurants across the world. The company is known for its customer service and family-friendly atmosphere, where women can receive manicures and kids are treated to candy floss while waiting for a table.","Two 17-year-old teenagers in Shanghai were ordered to pay $309,000 in damages for urinating in a hotpot at Haidilao and posting the video online.

Leviev previously denied the allegations. Leviev, 34, gained notoriety after an investigative documentary uncovered a string of romance fraud and financial crimes, involving an estimated $10m (£7.4m). Israeli Simon Leviev was taken into custody at Interpol's request after arriving at Batumi airport in the country's south-west, Georgia's interior ministry said on Monday. A convicted con artist who was the subject of a popular 2022 Netflix documentary, The Tinder Swindler, has been arrested in Georgia, local officials said. Authorities did not immediately provide details of the reason for the arrest of Leviev, whose real name is Shimon Yehuda Hayut. In 2019, Leviev was convicted of four charges of fraud in a separate case and sentenced to 15 months in prison, but he was released after serving only five months. According to Israel's Ynet website, his lawyer told reporters Leviev had been ""traveling freely around the world"". ""I spoke with him this morning after he was detained, but we don't yet understand the reason,"" they said after his arrest in Georgia. Between 2017 and 2019, Leviev's catfishing scheme - creating a false online persona - involved luring women into romantic relationships with an extravagant lifestyle of private jets and luxury holidays. His victims shared their stories in the documentary series, saying they were courted by Leviev with glamorous gifts and getaways to gain their trust. They said Leviev would later pretend he was being pursued by his ""enemies"" and ask them to transfer him significant sums of money, before breaking off all contact. Cecilie Fjellhøy, one of the women featured in the Netflix series, said she gave Leviev more than $270,000 over the course of their relationship. Last year, another woman Iren Tranov, filed a lawsuit against Leviev in Israel for 414,000 shekels (£91,000), saying she lent him more than 144,000 shekels (£31,000) which he never repaid. Leviev previously told BBC Newsbeat he strongly denied the accusations made against him in the documentary. Speaking to the BBC in 2023, Kate Konlin, a former girlfriend of Leviev's, also accused him of emotional and physical abuse while they were together. During an argument, Ms Konlin said he pushed her and she cut her foot on a step with a rough edge. ""I was bleeding. I felt dead. I wanted to kill myself,"" she said. After going to hospital, she filed a complaint against Leviev with the police. Leviev later rejected the accusations and said he had never physically harmed any woman.

Back then, in June 2019, as well as taking tea with the late Queen, the US President called London Mayor Sadiq Khan ""a stone-cold loser"", backed Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership race and suggested the NHS should be part of US-UK trade talks. All this was accompanied by a petition saying he should not receive a state visit in the UK, signed by more than one million people, as well as noisy protests involving thousands and a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby. This week's second state visit – unprecedented for a non-royal - will prove the first was no exception. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images Trump being invited for a second state visit is unprecedented for a non-royal (pictured above during his previous visit, with First Lady Melania, in 2019) There will again be protests and Lord Mandelson's sacking as UK ambassador to the US has already cast a diplomatic pall over proceedings. Planning for the visit - over Wednesday and Thursday - has gone on for months, but for all the careful preparation, the possibility that things could go wrong is still very real. And for many of those organising it, the Mandelson affair is only one of their worries. How Windsor became 'Trumpton' For those at the royal end of the show, the focus has been on logistics and security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel hard enough to satisfy even the most fastidious secret service agents. Such has been the huge American presence some locals have renamed Windsor ""Trumpton"", after the eponymous town in the 1970s children's TV show. Mark Kerrison/In Pictures via Getty Images Detailed planning for the visit has gone on for months, down to banquet menus, seating plans and wording of the King's seven-minute speech For Palace officials, attention to detail is all. One of the biggest problems has been finding a place to muster the Household Cavalry. It needs to be far enough from the helicopter landing zones to ensure the horses are not spooked by the noise, close enough to form the escort quickly that will accompany the Trumps' carriage procession through the grounds of Windsor Castle. There has also been much discussion between the Palace and Foreign Office over who sits where at the State Banquet in St George's Hall. ""The value of these things are not just the photo opportunities but also all the off-grid conversations,"" said one royal insider. ""A huge amount of attention goes into the seating plan for the banquet. So people with certain policy areas are sat next to one another."" Jonathan Brady - WPA Pool/Getty Images One challenge has been making sure that the helicopter landing zones are positioned to ensure the horses of the Mounted Household Cavalry (pictured) are not spooked by the noise Much thought, too, is devoted to the menu and the music which will involve ""lots of nods to his Scottish heritage"". King Charles III's seven-minute speech at the banquet has gone through many drafts, ensuring he pushes the right buttons without crossing political lines. Officials say they have been given no indication by their US counterparts of what Trump may say in his speech. 'Pressure to make this massive' So far, so logistical – but the key challenge for royal organisers has been finding a way of ensuring Trump feels he has been given a full state visit with all the trimmings. That is no easy task. The president is on the ground for less than 48 hours and will not visit Downing Street, address Parliament or even find time to play a round of golf. ""There has been a large amount of government pressure to make this massive and that's been the challenge,"" one courtier told me. Jeff Gilbert - WPA Pool/Getty Images President Trump (pictured on his first state visit to the UK) will return for a second state visit this Wednesday and Thursday The scale of the ceremonial at Windsor has been stepped up, with 1,300 troops and 120 horses involved - far more than those used when President Macron of France visited earlier this year. (It's a point that will no doubt be emphasised to the Americans in private.) For the ceremonial hoopla is the overwhelming focus of the White House in this visit; a chance for the President to be photographed with the King and Queen and the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with military parades and bands and the Red Arrows. One Whitehall source said: ""The focus is very much on the optics, the historic moment, the pomp. For Trump it's all about TV and this is great TV."" Another said: ""It's theatre. It's all show. It's not like we are going to do deep substance. We are sucking up to the most powerful guy in the world for good reason."" Peter Nicholls/Getty Images Members of the Guard of Honour rehearse the ceremonial welcome The Trumps: Warm and solicitous guests Lord McDonald, a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office, said the UK's strategic choice to afford the most powerful man in the world ""the fullest honour British protocol allows"" will be watched closely by the rest of the world. ""This state visit is not just a UK-US event,"" he said. ""It will be one of the biggest stories around the world. ""The rest of the world will be looking at London and Windsor, burnishing the UK's wider international standing."" Many officials are confident the visit will go smoothly, simply because all sides want it to succeed. They emphasise that Palace staff thought the Trumps were warm and solicitous guests in 2019, both keen not to put a foot wrong. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images President Trump and King Charles will both make speeches at a banquet during the state visit ""Trump can be quite funny in private,"" said one diplomat. ""He has got quite a neat turn of phrase that the King will appreciate."" For the UK government, the overwhelming aim is for Air Force One to take off on Thursday evening with Trump warmly disposed to Britain. Serious business behind the pageantry Beyond providing a day of royal pageantry, the government has business to conduct on Thursday when proceedings move to the prime minister's country residence at Chequers. Ministers hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffs. There will be some new civil nuclear cooperation. The centrepiece is set to be the signing of a technology partnership, involving new investment in Britain and greater cooperation with Silicon Valley on artificial intelligence and quantum computing. This was Lord Mandelson's priority, something he described in his outgoing letter to embassy staff last week as ""my personal pride and joy"", that he claimed would ""help write the next chapter of the special relationship"". All these issues will be portrayed as big domestic ""wins"" to help promote the government's growth agenda. Carl Court - Pool/Getty Images Ministers hope to complete a deal to exclude UK steel and aluminium from US tariffs The visit will also provide Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer with a significant opportunity to bend the ear of the president just a week before the United Nations general assembly in New York, especially on Ukraine. Jeremy Hunt, who as Foreign Secretary was heavily involved in the last Trump state visit, said this was a key chance to shape the president's thinking. ""Trump appears to be on a journey away from Putin, towards recognising that he needs a way of standing with his European allies a bit better,"" Hunt said. ""What the government will really be wanting to do is continue that journey, looking for a deal to impose more sanctions on countries buying Russian oil."" Leon Neal/Getty Images Planning has heavily focused on security - and turning Windsor Castle into a ring of steel Sophia Gaston, senior research fellow at King's College London, said the state visit was an important chance for the UK to influence US policy at a crucial stage of the Trump administration, a window of opportunity between its disruptive first six months and next year when its focus may shift to domestic elections and strategic competition with China. ""We are moving into a new phase,"" she said. ""This state visit really does matter. It is about us securing a foothold as the primary symbolic and strategic ally of the United States."" The Mandelson question For all these potential gains, the risks are huge and the most obvious involves, of course, Lord Mandelson. The peer's dismissal as ambassador, after revelations of the scale of his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein following Epstein's conviction as a paedophile, means the press conference at Chequers on Thursday will not be dominated by questions about his future. Instead, the prime minister will likely be asked why he appointed the peer in the first place and why he took so long to sack him; what did he know and when? Carl Court/Getty Images The PM will likely be asked why he appointed Lord Mandelson and why he took so long to sack him Some diplomats wonder if Trump may voice an opinion about who should replace Lord Mandelson, potentially putting No 10 in an invidious position. But perhaps the most dangerous question for the Prime Minister may be why he thinks Lord Mandelson should be punished for his links to Epstein, but not the US President standing next to him. According to Whitehall sources, this was a point Lord Mandelson deployed as he fought to save his job. It was not an argument that found favour in No 10 and officials note Trump, unlike Lord Mandelson, cut ties with Epstein well before his conviction - but it is a question that will float above this week's royal and political ceremonial. Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images Lord Mandelson, who has been sacked as UK ambassador to the US, pictured with Trump and Vance Diplomats I have spoken to insist that so far the White House has been sanguine - if not a little bemused - at Lord Mandelson's departure, saying it is the UK's business, and the president remains excited about the state visit. But there is a fear among some that if Trump were dragged into the controversy and embarrassed at the press conference, then that could sour his mood – and the visit. Profound differences in the UK and US The Mandelson affair is not the only potential challenge. As one distinguished former British ambassador told me: ""On values and policies, we have fundamental differences with the Trump administration – on Nato, Ukraine, Middle East and China. ""The differences are more profound than at any time since World War Two."" Perhaps the most acute difference that could overshadow the visit relates to the Middle East. Next week the UK is expected to formally recognise Palestinian statehood in an attempt to keep alive the idea of a so-called ""two state solution"". But the Americans are strongly opposed, as the Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, made clear on Friday, emphasising his commitment ""to fight anti-Israel actions including unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state that rewards Hamas terrorism"". Getty Images Protests took place in the UK during Trump's last state visit, and there was a huge inflatable effigy that became known as the Trump Baby There are also political risks for the prime minister. Underlying this state visit is an unspoken transaction: that it is worth giving Trump all those trimmings in order to help British interests, namely to reduce tariffs and foster investment partnerships. Yet Trump is unpopular in the UK. A YouGov poll in July found only 16% of Britons surveyed say they have a positive view of him. The government will have to explain to voters why it believes this state visit is a price worth paying to try to grow the British economy. The diplomatic game of cards Amid these potential pitfalls lies a deeper, but less discussed risk from this state visit. That is: in its diplomatic game of cards, has the government played its King too explicitly for political purposes? ""The government have the convening power of the King and they have used it in a very transactional way, for example the brandishing of the King's letter in the Oval Office,"" said one royal source. ""They realise the Palace can draw people in, in a way that you can't in Whitehall. Peter Summers/Getty Images There have only ever been three state visits by US presidents: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and President Trump in 2019 ""The problem in using the personality of the monarch and the institution of the monarchy is there is a risk that you cross a line and you ask someone who has to remain studiously non-political to transact a political act on behalf of the government."" Official state visits by US presidents are rare. There have only ever been three: President Bush in 2003; President Obama in 2011 and Trump in 2019. All other visits were official or informal. So this week's does matter. But even if it passes off smoothly and gaffe-free questions may remain about its efficacy. ""This is very early in Trump's presidency,"" one diplomat said. ""Have we played this card too soon? What do we do for an encore?""

In 1955, a Royal Navy commander told the BBC about securing Rockall, which remains the site of rival claims even today. In 1956, the British naturalist James Fisher described Rockall as ""the most isolated small rock in the oceans of the world"" – and understandably so. The island of Rockall is almost unimaginably remote, an 11-hour boat ride from Scotland's Outer Hebrides, and it is also tiny, measuring a mere 82ft (25m) wide, with a summit only 56ft (17m) above sea level. Most of it consists of bare, near-vertical granite, with just one small patch measuring 11ft by 4ft (3.5m by 1.3m) which is level enough to stand on. As insignificant as this jagged stone outcrop might appear, though, Queen Elizabeth II authorised the annexation of Rockall on 14 September 1955, instructing the Royal Navy to ""take possession of the island on our behalf"". Rockall's exact position was first charted by Royal Navy surveyor Captain ATE Vidal in 1831, but it was not until 1949 that Rockall became more widely known, after its name was given to one of the sea areas on BBC Radio's Shipping Forecast. It was around this time that the UK government recognised Rockall's strategic significance. As the Cold War intensified and Nato and Soviet submarines regularly patrolled the North Atlantic, securing Rockall was viewed as key to controlling sea space. Moreover, 230 miles (370km) east, on South Uist in the Outer Hebrides, the UK had established its first test site for US-made guided nuclear missiles. Nato documents, declassified in 1970, revealed the government's fear that ""hostile agents"" would install themselves on Rockall to spy on the results of the tests. WATCH: 'One of my jobs was to collect as many specimens as I could of Rockall'. A Royal Navy survey ship, HMS Vidal, reached the rock on 15 September 1955, but it would be another three days before high winds subsided enough to allow a helicopter to winch three Royal Marines on to it, along with James Fisher, a civilian scientist. There, the men planted the Union flag and formally claimed the islet for Britain. ""I had an instruction from Her Majesty to annexe the island of Rockall in her name,"" Commander Richard Connell, captain of HMS Vidal, told the BBC reporter Neville Barker shortly after the landing. ""We sent a signal to the Admiralty saying, 'Operation Rockall successfully completed.' I was never so glad to send any signal in my life."" Fisher was tasked with taking rock samples from the islet for study by the British Geological Society. Rockall was formed from the remains of an eroded volcano, and the granite found there was ""apparently unique"", Fisher told the BBC. Years later, geologists studying Rockall granite would identify a new mineral – bazirite – that had yet to be found anywhere else in the world.","Seventy years ago, the UK claimed Rockall, a tiny, remote, uninhabited island 260 miles west of Scotland's Outer Hebrides. Despite its small size—just 82ft wide and 56ft high—Rockall held strategic importance during the Cold War, as NATO and Soviet submarines patrolled the North Atlantic and the UK tested nuclear missiles nearby. On 14 September 1955, Queen Elizabeth II authorized its annexation, and a Royal Navy team, including three Royal Marines and naturalist James Fisher, landed on the rock, raised the Union flag, and formally claimed it for Britain. Fisher collected rock samples for the British Geological Society, revealing unique granite that later led to the discovery of a new mineral, bazirite.","सत्तर साल पहले, ब्रिटेन ने रॉकॉल नामक एक छोटे और निर्जन द्वीप पर दावा किया, जो स्कॉटलैंड के आउटर हिब्रिडीज़ से 260 मील पश्चिम में स्थित है। यह द्वीप आकार में बहुत छोटा है—सिर्फ 82 फीट चौड़ा और 56 फीट ऊँचा—फिर भी शीत युद्ध के दौरान इसकी सामरिक महत्ता थी, क्योंकि नाटो और सोवियत पनडुब्बियाँ उत्तरी अटलांटिक में गश्त करती थीं और ब्रिटेन ने पास में परमाणु मिसाइल परीक्षण किए थे। 14 सितंबर 1955 को, क्वीन एलिज़ाबेथ द्वितीय ने द्वीप के अधिग्रहण की अनुमति दी। रॉयल नेवी की टीम, जिसमें तीन रॉयल मरीन और प्राकृतिकविद जेम्स फिशर शामिल थे, रॉकॉल पर उतरे, यूनियन फ्लैग लगाया और इसे औपचारिक रूप से ब्रिटेन के लिए दावा किया। फिशर ने ब्रिटिश जियोलॉजिकल सोसाइटी के लिए चट्टानों के नमूने इकट्ठे किए, जिनसे अद्वितीय ग्रेनाइट सामने आया और बाद में एक नया खनिज, बाज़िराइट, खोजा गया।",en,[],,"In 1955, the British Empire planted the Union flag in its last piece of territory – a bleak, uninhabited rock.

Pilots, medical professionals, teachers and one Secret Service employee are among those who have been suspended or sacked for social media posts that were deemed inappropriate about Kirk's death. Critics have argued the firings threaten free speech and employee protections, although US companies have wide latitude to terminate employees. Vance's comments aired on Monday in an episode of the Charlie Kirk Show, a daily podcast that Kirk hosted before he was shot in the neck last Wednesday while hosting a debate at Utah Valley University. In the episode, the vice-president said that left-wing Americans ""are much likelier to defend and celebrate political violence"", and added that ""there is no civility in the celebration of political assassination"". Charlie Kirk: Conservative influencer who rallied a youth movement Charlie Kirk suspect linked to crime scene by DNA, says FBI chief A recent YouGov poll found liberal Americans were more likely than conservatives to defend feeling joy about the deaths of political opponents. Vance's remarks come as other Republican US lawmakers echoed calls for those publicly celebrating Kirk's death to be punished. ""I will demand their firing, defunding, and license revocation,"" said Florida congressman Randy Fine in a post on X on Sunday, as he called for such people to ""be thrown out of civil society"". South Carolina congresswoman Nancy Mace urged the Department of Education to ""cut off every dime to any school or university"" that refuses to retaliate against employees making insensitive posts about Kirk. Kirk, a devout Christian, professed viewpoints on gender, race and abortion that drew backlash from many liberals, especially on the campuses he toured. In some cases, those who took to social media to gloat over his death or post comments that caused offence have been fired or placed on leave by employers. Among them is Anthony Pough, a US Secret Service employee who wrote on Facebook that Kirk ""spewed hate and racism on his show... at the end of the day, you answer to GOD, and speak things into existence"". He has had his security clearance revoked. Secret Service Director Sean Curran wrote in a memo to staff that politically motivated attacks are on the rise and members of the protective detail should not be exacerbating the issue. ""The men and women of the Secret Service must be focused on being the solution, not adding to the problem,"" Curran wrote. Americans employed by private companies have also come under scrutiny. Office Depot fired employees at a Michigan branch after a viral video showed staff refusing to print posters for a Kirk vigil, the company confirmed to the BBC in a statement.

It's summer 1998, and he's hunched over the turntables at New York's venerable VIP bar, Spy. Ronson is there to DJ for Prince, the Purple pipsqueak of funk. It's going well, until he pulls Michael Jackson's Off The Wall from its sleeve, ready to drop the 1979 disco classic Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough. Suddenly, someone's tugging at his arm. It's the rapper Q-Tip, and there's an uncommon urgency to his voice as he shouts: ""No! You can't play that. Not in front of Prince!"" Remembering the star's rivalry with Jackson in the 1980s, Ronson whips the record off the decks. But that leaves him with a problem. ""At this point there's only 20 seconds left [of the previous song]. I pull another record out, but the tempos don't match and I flub the mix."" Ronson glances over to the VIP area, where Prince is holding court in a plush throne. ""And he's glaring down at me like, 'What is this train wreck?' ""It was slightly humiliating."" Getty Images Ronson started DJing in his teens and cut his teeth in the clubs of New York Luckily, train wrecks were a rarity. Long before he was an Oscar-winning hitmaker for Lady Gaga and Amy Winehouse, Ronson was one of New York's most in-demand DJs. A nocturnal animal, he'd bait his prey with crates of vinyl, swooping in for the kill with a perfectly-timed drop of AC/DC's Back In Black or Busta Rhymes' Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See. ""I could walk into any room and, almost like the Terminator, scan the crowd and be like, 'I know what the first three records are',"" he says. That's as close to boastfulness as Ronson gets. He's so laid-back it's almost comical, speaking in a perpetually sleepy drawl, like the Big Lebowski of music. Mark Ronson The musician started his vinyl habit early We meet in Notting Hill's Music and Video Exchange – the shop that kick-started his record collection – and it's only when he starts rifling through the racks that the 50-year-old comes to life. ""This one changed my life,"" he says, pulling out a dog-eared copy of Pete Rock's They Reminisce Over You. ""Oh, and here's Salt-N-Pepa's Shoop… Now, that's my song!"" A similar enthusiasm permeates Ronson's new memoir, Night People, which concentrates on the 1990s DJ career that saw him playing for everyone from Jay-Z to Mariah Carey. ""She had very specific songs she wanted to hear,"" he recalls. ""There was a great R&B record called Say I'm Your Number One, by Princess, that she'd always request. ""Eventually, I just knew to play it as soon as I saw her, to save her a trip to the booth."" When he pitched the book, which ends long before his successes with Winehouse on Back To Black and Bruno Mars on Uptown Funk, ""people were scratching their heads"", Ronson admits. ""They were like, 'Oh right, so you want to write about the time before the thing we know you for?'"" Getty Images Ronson produced several of the key tracks on Amy Winehouse's Back To Black, including Rehab and the title song But he stuck to his guns. The memoir is a heartfelt love letter to a bygone era, inspired by the death of his close friend and contemporary DJ Blu Jemz in 2018. ""I was just staring at all the records [we used to play] on my shelf, thinking about how each one was so evocative of a memory and a moment in time. ""It's arguably the last time New York was the apex of hip-hop both creatively and commercially - A Tribe Called Quest, Wu-Tang, Biggie Smalls, Lil' Kim, Busta Rhymes... all of it. And they were out in the clubs every night."" Another figure who loomed over the scene was P Diddy, aka Sean Combs, who's currently awaiting sentencing in New York after being found guilty on two counts of transportation for the purposes of prostitution. Diddy gave Ronson one of his big breaks, hiring him to play at A-list events, including his 29th birthday party, after tipping the DJ with a $100 bill containing his phone number. ""It's undeniable that the way he picked me for certain gigs elevated my star,"" says Ronson, calling the accusations against Diddy ""horrific"". ""I had no idea of anything like that going on,"" he says, acknowledging the musician ""wielded a tremendous amount of power and cachet"" in New York. ""But in the five years I DJ'd for him, I doubt he spoke more than five sentences to me. ""He was mostly out there dancing and I knew if he was dancing, no-one was gonna yell at me."" Mark Ronson Ronson's mother Ann Dexter-Jones later divorced his father Laurence Ronson and married Foreigner guitarist Mick Jones, who wrote I Want To Know What Love Is for her At the outset, Ronson wanted his book to capture the seediness of 90s club culture, where he'd play ""night in, night out for $100"" while ""cokehead club owners shouted at me for not playing enough Madonna"". As he wrote, another story also emerged. Ronson was born in London to jewellery designer Ann Dexter-Jones and music publisher Laurence Ronson. Their house in St John's Wood was a frequent haunt for actors and musicians, including Keith Moon and Robin Williams. ""My parents had crazy parties all the time,"" he recalls. ""Fifty or 60 slightly cracked people, smoking, drinking, having a great time."" The aftermath was drastically different. In the book, he writes of ""angry crescendos and heavy silences"" from his parents' bedroom, which instilled a ""constant watchfulness that became instinct before I understood why"". Later in life, DJing fulfilled a ""need for control"" that stemmed from that early instability. ""It wasn't always the greatest way to grow up for a kid, and there was something about the DJ booth that was incredibly comforting. ""It's like I'm an army of one. I make all the rules. It's a refuge, in a way."" Getty Images Ronson won an Oscar for co-writing Shallow with Lady Gaga, Andrew Wyatt (left) and Anthony Rossomando (second left) Learning to navigate delicate situations also helped Ronson's career as a producer. There's an almost too-perfect example in Lady Gaga's documentary Five Foot Two where, arriving for a recording session, the star crashes into Ronson's car. Mortified, she enters the studio in a garbled flurry of apologies. Ronson simply stretches out his arms for a conciliatory hug. ""If you have a problem, I wish you'd just say it to my face instead of my bumper,"" he deadpans. The situation is immediately defused. Reminded of the scene, he says: ""I remember working on that record [2016's Joanne] pretty well, and Lady Gaga is probably one of the most chased, hounded, paparazzi-ed people you could imagine. ""Sometimes we'd slam the door and there'd be 20 people on the other side taking pictures. So my role is just to shut out the outside world [and] make the artist feel relaxed and comfortable at all times. ""Even when they've trashed your car."" Ronson spent hours rifling through the racks at shops like London's Music and Video Exchange as an aspiring teenage DJ","Mark Ronson, the acclaimed UK producer behind hits for Amy Winehouse, Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars, and others, reflects on his early DJ career in his memoir Night People. Starting in New York clubs in the 1990s, he honed his skills as a “night person,” reading crowds and dropping tracks perfectly. He recounts playing for Prince, navigating tricky requests from celebrities, and working under influential figures like P Diddy. Ronson also shares personal insights, growing up in a household filled with creative chaos and celebrity guests, which instilled a sense of watchfulness and a need for control. His producer role, he notes, requires diplomacy, exemplified by handling incidents like Lady Gaga accidentally damaging his car, which he defused calmly to keep artists comfortable in the studio. The memoir captures the energy, creativity, and intensity of 1990s New York club culture.","मार्क रॉनसन, जो एमी वाइनहाउस, लेडी गागा, ब्रूनो मार्स और अन्य कलाकारों के लिए हिट्स बनाने वाले प्रसिद्ध ब्रिटिश निर्माता हैं, ने अपनी शुरुआती डीजे करियर के अनुभवों को अपनी संस्मरण नाइट पीपल में साझा किया है। 1990 के दशक में न्यूयॉर्क के क्लबों में डीजेिंग करते हुए उन्होंने अपनी क्षमताओं को निखारा और भीड़ का मूड पढ़कर परफेक्ट ट्रैक बजाना सीखा। वह प्रिंस के लिए खेलने, सेलिब्रिटी की मांगों को संभालने और पी. डिडी जैसे प्रभावशाली लोगों के साथ काम करने की कहानियाँ साझा करते हैं। रॉनसन अपने व्यक्तिगत जीवन के अनुभव भी बताते हैं, जिसमें उन्होंने एक ऐसे घर में पालन-पोषण किया जहाँ रचनात्मक उन्माद और सेलिब्रिटी मेहमान आम थे, जिससे सतर्क रहने और नियंत्रण की आवश्यकता विकसित हुई। उनके निर्माता के रूप में काम में कूटनीति की जरूरत होती है, जैसे कि लेडी गागा द्वारा गलती से उनकी कार को नुकसान पहुँचाने की घटना को शांतिपूर्वक संभालना। यह संस्मरण 1990 के दशक के न्यूयॉर्क क्लब संस्कृति की ऊर्जा, रचनात्मकता और तीव्रता को दर्शाता है।",en,[],,"Mark Ronson looks back on a troubled childhood, and how it informed his career as a DJ and producer.",[''],www.bbc.com_sport,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""In stark contrast to the lies in the report, Hamas is the party that attempted genocide in Israel - murdering 1,200 people, raping women, burning families alive, and openly declaring its goal of killing every Jew,"" they added. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the unprecedented Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. At least 64,905 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of the population has also been repeatedly displaced; more than 90% of homes are estimated to be damaged or destroyed; the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed; and UN-backed food security experts have declared a famine in Gaza City. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory was established by the UN Human Rights Council in 2021 to investigate all alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.

We have virtually no crime in DC right now, and we're going to keep it that way,"" he said, noting that he still has his sights set on Chicago and St Louis, Missouri. ""We're not going to allow this kind of savagery to destroy our society anymore,"" Trump said at a memorandum-signing in the Oval Office. The president said on Monday, however, that Memphis is ""overrun"" with carjackings, robberies and shootings, as well as other crimes. Lee praised his efforts for ""sustained crime lowering"" in the state. In an interview with CNN on Saturday, Young said he was ""not happy"" about federal plans to deploy the National Guard to Memphis - he said the plan was first confirmed to him by Trump on Fox News the day before. ""My goal is to make sure that if they are indeed coming, that we have an opportunity to drive some of the decisions around how they engage in our community,"" he said. ""It is something that we don't have a choice in,"" he added. ""We're going to do all that we can to make sure it has limited impact on our communities."" Republican lawmakers in the state - including Governor Lee - have expressed support. The governor said last week that he already was working on a plan with the White House that would bring ""the full extent of both federal and state resources"" to bear in Memphis. FBI statistics from 2024 show that Memphis has 2,501 violent crimes per 100,000 people, one of the highest rates of any US city. BBC Verify analysis of FBI crime statistics for several US cities found that in 2024, Memphis topped the rankings for homicide rates with 41 homicides per 100,000 people. It was followed by Baltimore with 35 homicides per 100,000 people. Chicago ranked tenth out 37 US cities with a population of more than 500,000 people. The proclamation comes after weeks of speculation on where he might next deploy federal resources to fight crime. In addition to Chicago, the president had mentioned New Orleans - welcomed by Louisiana governor Jeff Landry - and Baltimore. On 11 August, Trump took charge of Washington DC's police department, and also activated National Guard units and began a surge of federal law enforcement officers. More than 2,000 arrests have been made and hundreds of illegal firearms seized since then, which administration officials repeatedly have pointed to as signs their strategy in the city is working. Polls show, however, that the deployment of National Guard troops in the city is unpopular among many local residents, and legal experts have questioned the legality of using troops in US cities. Earlier in September, a federal judge in California ruled that Trump's deployment of troops to quell unrest in Los Angeles this summer was illegal, although the ruling does not apply to other cities.","US President Donald Trump has announced a federal crackdown on crime in Memphis, Tennessee, modeled on efforts in Washington DC. The initiative will involve federal agencies including the National Guard, FBI, ICE, ATF, and the Department of Justice. Trump described Memphis as “overrun” with carjackings, robberies, shootings, and other crimes, and vowed to address these issues step by step, claiming DC now has “virtually no crime.”

Tennessee Governor Bill Lee has supported the plan, while Memphis Mayor Paul Young opposed it, arguing that crime is already declining without federal intervention and expressing concerns about its impact on local communities. FBI statistics show Memphis had 2,501 violent crimes per 100,000 people in 2024, including a homicide rate of 41 per 100,000, the highest among major US cities.

Trump’s crackdown follows weeks of speculation about federal interventions in other cities such as Chicago, St Louis, New Orleans, and Baltimore. Previous deployments, like in Washington DC, have resulted in over 2,000 arrests and hundreds of firearms seized, but public opinion remains divided, and legal experts have questioned the legality of using federal troops domestically.","इज़राइल के प्रधानमंत्री बेंजामिन नेतन्याहू ने विदेशों में हमास के नेताओं पर और हमलों को अस्वीकार नहीं किया है, पिछले सप्ताह कतर में हुए इज़राइली हमले के बाद। जेरूसलम में अमेरिकी विदेश सचिव मार्को रूबियो के साथ प्रेस कॉन्फ्रेंस में नेतन्याहू ने कहा कि हमास के नेताओं को “कहीं भी सुरक्षा नहीं मिलेगी” और हर देश को अपनी सीमाओं के बाहर भी आत्मरक्षा का अधिकार है। कतर, जो अमेरिकी सहयोगी और हमास का राजनीतिक ब्यूरो स्थल है, पर हमला अंतरराष्ट्रीय आलोचना का विषय बना, हालांकि नेतन्याहू ने कहा कि यह हमला स्वतंत्र रूप से किया गया था। रूबियो ने कहा कि अमेरिका और खाड़ी देशों के संबंध मजबूत हैं।

The fishing gong is calling. At 05:00 local time, the clang of a hammer on an old oxygen gas cylinder wakes me up. It's fishing day on Tristan da Cunha, a speck of land in the South Atlantic Ocean that is home to barely more than 200 people. Beyond the UK Overseas Territory, the nearest inhabited settlement lies more than 2,400km (1,491 miles) away. As the gong fades, dogs bark, engines rev, and the scrape of rubber boots echoes through the air as fishermen head to Callshot Harbor, nicknamed ""the Beach"", to bait their traps and ready their boats. With just 18 to 72 fishing days per season, every opportunity counts. They're after Tristan's most valuable commodity: the St Paul spiny lobster (Jasus paulensis), found only near remote islands in the world's southern oceans. Prized for their sweet, delicate meat, a single tail can fetch $39 (£29) on the US market. The lobsters are also sold in Japan and the UK. Here in the cool, temperate waters of the Tristan da Cunha archipelago, the crustaceans thrive close to shore, at depths of up to 200m (656 ft). But Tristan has not always been able to depend on its lobster bounty. Decades ago, heavy fishing caused a significant reduction in lobster numbers here. Today, Tristanians depend on the catch – but they also know that, without proper protections, the lobsters are at risk.","Tristan da Cunha, the world's most remote inhabited island (population ~200), is fiercely protecting its lobster fishery, the island's sole source of income.  Located over 2,400km from the nearest inhabited land, Tristan's economy hinges on the St Paul spiny lobster, prized globally for its delicate meat and fetching up to $39 per tail.  Past overfishing drastically depleted the lobster population, highlighting the fragility of this isolated ecosystem.  With only 18-72 fishing days per season, the islanders are meticulously managing their resource to ensure its long-term sustainability and economic viability.

Speaking on Monday in front of parliament's public accounts committee, Davie said the BBC would ""work with"" Eurovision organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), on the issue. ""Eurovision has never been about politics, it should be a celebration of music and culture that brings people together,"" he added. ""We need to see what the broadcast union decides."" Fellow broadcasters from Ireland, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Iceland and now Spain have all threatened to boycott the event if Israel is allowed to take part over the country's actions in Gaza. PA The BBC director general is also on the executive board of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) ""We're very aware of the concerns,"" the BBC boss, who is also on the executive board of the EBU, told the committee. ""It's obviously a well-debated topic and difficult. ""At this stage we are supportive of the European Broadcast Union's work. They are going around discussing with members, working through all the processes by which they would be satisfied to make a decision one way or the other."" He added that it was ""really important that we try to preserve"" the celebratory element of the contest. ""But at this stage, I'm supporting the European Broadcasting Union's work, and they need to get on with it."" The EBU will make a final decision at a meeting in December. On Friday, leaders of the Green parties of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland urged a potential UK boycott in a joint letter to Davie. Earlier this year, more than 70 former Eurovision contestants signed a letter calling on the organisers to ban Israel from the 2025 competition in Basel, which Austrian singer JJ won after a nail-biting finish that saw him topple Israel from pole position at the very last minute. As a result, next summer's event will be held in the Austrian capital of Vienna. Getty Images Next summer's Eurovision song contest will take place in Vienna, Austria Spain's culture minister Ernest Urtasun has now said Israel should not take part, repeating calls made by the country's prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, earlier this year. In 2024, Spain joined Norway and Ireland in acknowledging a Palestinian state and last week, Sánchez accused Israel of genocide and announced a series of measures against it, including an arms embargo. Israel's foreign minister Gideon Saar responded by accusing Sanchez's administration of being antisemitic and of using ""wild and hateful rhetoric"". Germany and Italy have both said they will withdraw if Israel is expelled. When Russia was expelled from the song contest back in 2022 following its invasion of Ukraine, it was because it was felt Russian broadcasters were no longer independent from the Russian government. Many within Eurovision don't think this applies to Israel's public broadcaster. Before making this decision, the EBU said it had taken time to consult widely among its membership. Ukraine went on to win the contest. In August, the UN-backed food monitor, the IPC, confirmed that famine was taking place in parts of Gaza. Israel is accused of causing the famine through ongoing restrictions on food and medical aid entering the territory. Israel controls all border crossings into the Gaza Strip, and as the occupying power bears responsibility for protecting civilian life under international law, which includes the prevention of starvation. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly denied starvation is taking place in Gaza and has said that where there is hunger, it is the fault of aid agencies and Hamas. Israel has regularly denied that its actions in Gaza amount to genocide and says they are justified as a means of self-defence. Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 64,871 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Political messages Getty Images Dancers for Madonna displayed flags of both Israel and Palestine on their backs during the star's guest performance at Eurovision 2019 in Tel Aviv","The future of Israel's participation in the 2025 Eurovision Song Contest, to be held in Vienna, is uncertain.  Several European broadcasters have threatened a boycott if Israel is allowed to compete, citing concerns over the ongoing conflict in Gaza and accusations of human rights abuses.  BBC director-general Tim Davie, a member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU)'s executive board, stated that Eurovision should remain apolitical, focusing on music and culture.  While acknowledging the controversy, he expressed support for the EBU's ongoing consultations with member broadcasters, deferring the final decision to their December meeting.  The EBU has previously consulted widely on the matter and has yet to make a statement.  The controversy follows calls from former Eurovision contestants and Green Party leaders urging a boycott.  The situation highlights the tension between the contest's apolitical aims and the significant geopolitical context surrounding Israel's participation.

The whole area echoes to the sound of exploding mortar and artillery shells. Helicopter gunships join the attack, while surveillance drones sweep overhead to view the damage. There are giant explosions as Sukhoi-34 bombers drop guided bombs. Huge plumes of smoke darken the sky. The BBC's Steve Rosenberg says the drills come at a time of ""high tension"" Together with other international media we've been brought to the Borisovsky training ground where Belarusian and Russian forces are taking part in joint manoeuvres. It's part of the Zapad-2025 (""West 2025"") military drills. Military attachés, too, from a variety of embassies are observing the drill from a viewing platform. These are planned exercises - ""West 2025"" takes place every four years. In 2022 200,000 troops took part, while this year's exercises involved fewer soldiers. Moscow and Minsk maintain that the drills are of a purely defensive nature, that they're designed to strengthen the security of Russia and Belarus and to counter any potential external threat. I remember hearing similar claims three and a half years ago. In February 2022 I visited Belarus to report on the Belarusian-Russian military exercise ""Union Resolve"". When the exercise was over, instead of returning home Russian troops invaded neighbouring Ukraine from the territory of Belarus. This time Belarus insists it has nothing to hide. Representatives of 23 states, including the US, Turkey and Hungary, watched the military exercise. ""We consider that the exercise is unprecedented in its transparency,"" Major General Valery Revenko, assistant to the Belarusian defence minister, told journalists at the training ground. ""We are not threatening anyone. We are for constructive and pragmatic dialogue."" Clearly Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk isn't convinced. He had dubbed the ""West 2025"" drills ""very aggressive"". Poland shut its border with Belarus ahead of the exercises, prompting an angry response from Minsk. ""West 2025"" coincides with a period of heightened tension in the eastern European region. To the south, Russia shows no sign of ending its war on Ukraine. Last week Poland accused Russia of intentionally violating its air space with a Russian drone incursion. Nato scrambled fighter jets to shoot down some of the drones. Moscow responded by claiming that it ""hadn't planned to engage targets on Polish territory."" Yesterday Romania revealed that a Russian drone had breached its airspace, too. In Europe there is widespread concern that such drone incursions are no accident, but a Russian strategy to test the unity and resolve of European leaders and of the Nato alliance. Both Russia and Belarus have made efforts recently to improve ties with Washington and to construct a relationship with the Trump administration. But in the case of both Moscow and Minsk relations with Europe remain strained. The decision by the Belarusian authorities to invite international media to the ""West 2025"" exercise can be seen two ways. First, as an attempt at transparency - that's certainly how Minsk is portraying it. But in the explosions and the gunfire on the Borisovsky training ground there is, perhaps too, a message for the West. And first and foremost, for Europe. That message may read something like this: ""See and consider the firepower on your doorstep; confrontation with Moscow is not in your best interest.""","Amid heightened tensions in Eastern Europe, Russia and Belarus conducted the joint military exercise ""Zapad-2025,"" one of the world's largest, involving a smaller number of troops than the 200,000 participating in 2022.  While Moscow and Minsk described the drills as purely defensive, the show of force, featuring artillery, helicopter gunships, and drones, was widely interpreted as a message to Europe.  The exercises, observed by military attachés from various countries, including the US, occurred at the Borisovsky training ground.  The timing coincides with recent airspace violations by Russian drones in Poland and Romania, raising concerns about a deliberate Russian strategy to test European unity.  Although Belarus invited international media to observe the drills, aiming for transparency, the display of military might fueled anxieties about potential escalation and the implications for regional security.  Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk criticized the drills as ""very aggressive,"" and Poland closed its border with Belarus in response.  Despite both Russia and Belarus' recent attempts to improve relations with the US, tensions with Europe remain high.

According to the spokesperson, Tyler Robinson, 22, messaged friends in a chat on Discord hours before he was arrested last week in connection with Kirk's shooting at an event at Utah Valley University. ""It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this,"" reads a message from an account that allegedly belongs to Robinson, according to the spokesperson and a law enforcement source. Robinson, who has not yet been formally charged, is due to appear in court on Tuesday. Arrested on suspicion of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm and obstruction of justice, he could face the death penalty. The Discord messages which are said to be from Robinson were first reported by the Washington Post and are thought to have been written and posted towards the end of a manhunt for Kirk's killer that lasted more than a day. Charlie Kirk, 31, who was a controversial figure in US politics and a trusted ally of President Donald Trump, was speaking at Utah Valley University on Wednesday at an open-air event held by Turning Point USA - the organisation he co-founded - when he was hit in the neck by a single bullet. The killing of the popular social media personality sparked outrage, with Democrats and Republicans accusing each other of spreading hateful rhetoric, and a hunt for his killer. Utah's Governor Spencer Cox said Robinson had been arrested after confessing about Kirk's killing to his father and being persuaded to hand himself in. Law enforcement sources have told CBS News that Robinson and his friends bantered about the shooting before his arrest in a group chat on Discord involving more than 20 people. The spokesperson for the platform said that an internal investigation by the company had found ""no evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence on Discord"". Robinson is said to have been questioned in the group about whether he was the gunman, which he did not appear to reject, and there were also jokes from one group member about him needing to avoid McDonald's, which is where Luigi Mangione, the alleged killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was arrested. Messages from the account thought to belong to Robinson also indicate that he was planning to hand himself in. ""im surrendering through a sheriff friend in a few moments, thanks for all the good times and laughs, you've all been so amazing, thank you all for everything,"" reads one. Cox has said that Robinson was not co-operating with authorities but his roommate was among those who were. FBI director Kash Patel, who has been criticised over his handling of the case, told Fox News in an interview on Monday that a text message exchange had been found on Robinson's phone in which he ""specifically stated that he had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk, and he was going to do that"". EPA/Shutterstock Vigils have been held in the US and in other countries in memory of Charlie Kirk Investigators have been trying to establish a motive for the killing. Cox has previously said that Robinson, a Utah native, was ""deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology"". Public records reviewed by the BBC suggest Robinson had in the past registered as an unaffiliated, or nonpartisan, voter in Utah. His parents are registered Republicans, according to state records. However, according to Cox, a family member told investigators that Robinson had become ""more political"" in recent years and had specifically mentioned Kirk's impending visit to Utah Valley University during a dinner. One of Donald Trump's top officials, deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, has alleged that there was an organised campaign behind the assassination, but no evidence has been presented so far that suggests Robinson was working as part of a group. He was speaking on Kirk's podcast, the Charlie Kirk Show, which was guest-hosted by his friend, Vice President JD Vance, in an episode that aired on Monday. Investigators are also looking at social media accounts used by Robinson, according to CBS, and any signs that anyone may have known about or encouraged the shooting beforehand.","Tyler Robinson, 22, is being held without bail in Utah County Jail following his arrest in connection with the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University.  Robinson allegedly confessed to the shooting in Discord messages sent hours before his arrest, stating, ""It was me at UVU yesterday.""  While not yet formally charged, he is suspected of aggravated murder, felony discharge of a firearm, and obstruction of justice, facing a potential death penalty.  Kirk, 31, was struck in the neck and survived the attack, sparking widespread outrage and accusations of hateful rhetoric from both Democrats and Republicans.  Governor Spencer Cox stated Robinson's father persuaded him to surrender, though Robinson initially wasn't cooperating with authorities.  Discord's internal investigation found no evidence of pre-planning or promotion of violence on their platform.  While Robinson's political affiliation is unclear (having registered as unaffiliated despite Republican parents), a family member noted his increasing political engagement.  Investigators are exploring potential motives and examining Robinson's social media activity for evidence of conspiracy or encouragement.  The investigation continues, with claims of an organized campaign behind the shooting being investigated.

Researchers found that the crusts - deposits formed due to chemical interactions between pollutants and the walls of the red sandstone fort - were between 0.05mm and 0.5mm thick, and could damage its intricate carvings if no action was taken. The study is the first of its kind to comprehensively examine the effects of air pollution on the 17th Century monument.

Researchers from the University of Manchester, working with Indian and Italian colleagues, found that air pollution is creating black crusts (0.05-0.5mm thick) on the 17th-century monument's red sandstone walls, threatening its intricate carvings.  This flaking, exacerbated by humidity, is the result of chemical reactions between pollutants and the stone.  The study, conducted between 2021 and 2023, highlights the devastating impact of Delhi's notoriously poor air quality on its historical heritage, echoing previous concerns about damage to other landmarks like the Taj Mahal.  The Red Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage site and the location of India's Independence Day celebrations, is facing significant deterioration due to this ongoing environmental assault.

""The grass can be wet, but basically the water needs to be gone… Yeh I think that's gone. OK, good, give it a stop.""","Urban miniature forests, cultivated using the Miyawaki method, are proving beneficial for both city environments and residents.  A recent demonstration at Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh showed how these quickly growing forests improve water absorption compared to surrounding areas. Children participating in the experiment enthusiastically measured the rate of water absorption in the miniature forest, highlighting the engaging and educational aspects of these green spaces.  The project underscores the positive impact of such initiatives on urban sustainability.

Five sheriff officers entered the makeshift encampment in woodland near Jedburgh at 08:00 while the three members of the self-proclaimed Kingdom of Kubala group were still asleep. The group packed up their belongings and moved them the short distance to a new site in the woodland, on the other side of a wire fence. The ""tribe"" have been living in the wood for several weeks despite formal attempts to remove them from the land. The eviction order was issued by Sheriff Peter Paterson last week after the group ignored a previous instruction to leave their encampment. They said they were reclaiming land that was stolen from their ancestors 400 years ago - but the local council said they were breaking the law. The group have a growing online presence, with more than 100,000 followers on TikTok and Facebook, and have received worldwide media attention. Ghanaian Kofi Offeh, 36, and Jean Gasho, 42, who is originally from Zimbabwe, first arrived in the Jedburgh area in the spring. Describing themselves as King Atehehe and Queen Nandi, they set up camp on a hillside above the town in the Scottish Borders. They were joined by ""handmaiden"" Kaura Taylor, from Texas, who calls herself Asnat. The eviction was carried out by sheriff officers, who were supported by four police officers, on Tuesday morning. Shouting could be heard from the woods as they woke them. The officials remained on site for about 90 minutes, by which time the tribe's tents had been dismantled and their possessions packed up. The group then set up a new camp just metres away on the other side a of a wire fence. They would not directly comment when asked by BBC Scotland what had happened. The three previously camped on the left of the wire fence and have now moved a few metres to the right The group claimed ancestral rights to land and insisted that the Kingdom of Kubala had been born. Scottish Borders Council initially evicted the trio from the hillside site above Jedburgh in July. But rather than leave the area, they moved about a mile further out of town to a woodland next to an industrial estate. Mr Offeh previously said he was ""not afraid"" of the warrant for their eviction. The land's owners, David and Mary Palmer, successfully applied to the courts for the tribe to be evicted. The camp is located near Jedburgh in the south of Scotland","A self-proclaimed ""tribe,"" the Kingdom of Kubala, led by Kofi Offeh and Jean Gasho,  was evicted from woodland near Jedburgh, Scotland, on Tuesday morning.  Sheriff officers, supported by police, removed the group's belongings after they ignored previous eviction orders.  Despite the eviction, the group, which boasts a significant online following, simply relocated their camp a short distance away, across a wire fence.  The group, who claim ancestral rights to the land, have been living in the area for several weeks, repeatedly defying attempts by the landowners and Scottish Borders Council to remove them.

But horrifying though they are, those reports are not as visceral as the experience of watching The Lost Bus. Paul Greengrass' enthralling film – with Matthew McConaughey as a school bus driver trying to get children to safety as a fire blazes around them, and America Ferrara as a teacher on board – is based on the true story of that rescue during the 2018 Camp Fire, not to be confused with the fires earlier this year that destroyed so much of the Pacific Palisades and Altadena neighbourhoods of California. Greengrass immerses us in the fires in all their noise, heat and apparently inescapable danger. Because the real story is known, we can approach the film assured that everyone gets out alive. The film is ultimately about heroic actions. That doesn't lessen the tension, as burning tree limbs fall in the bus's path and the sky darkens with smoke so that day looks like night. The Lost Bus demonstrates how powerfully drama can illuminate a story we might have thought we knew. The film stays so close to reality that the main characters' names have not been changed. McConaughey plays Kevin McKay, who responds to a dispatcher's urgent call for any bus near the school, in the fire's evacuation zone. Ferrera is Mary Ludwig, a teacher who shepherds 22 small children onto the bus that is meant to take them to where their parents are waiting in a designated area. But the fire is already so far out of control that the journey is more harrowing than anyone expects. As the film depicts in some alarming early scenes, a faulty power line sparked the fire, and a fierce wind sent it spreading so fast that the firefighters couldn't contain it. (Throughout, to create the dramatic fire scenes, the production safely set gas fires, sometimes enhanced by CGI and footage of real fires.) The noise of the fire is a loud relentless roar, an especially effective way to let us share their experience Greengrass, known for his three Jason Bourne films and the fact-based stories Captain Phillips and United 93, brings all of his expertise to bear here, generating suspense from volatile action and the characters' emotional responses to danger. The noise of the fire is a loud relentless roar, an especially effective way to let us share their experience. Kevin has to drive along winding back roads, where at times the smoke is so thick he can barely see. Phone service and the bus's radio go down, cutting off communication with the outside world. Kevin and Mary are on their own.","Paul Greengrass's ""The Lost Bus,"" airing Thursday at 9 pm on BBC1, recounts the harrowing true story of a school bus driver, Kevin McKay (Matthew McConaughey), and a teacher, Mary Ludwig (America Ferrara), evacuating 22 children during the devastating 2018 Camp Fire.  The film vividly portrays the chaotic escape, utilizing a combination of controlled gas fires, CGI, and real wildfire footage to recreate the intense heat, smoke, and roaring flames.  While the outcome is known, the realistic depiction of the near-miss creates gripping tension as the bus navigates treacherous roads and loses communication, highlighting the heroic actions of those involved in the rescue.  Greengrass, known for his intense, fact-based films, masterfully immerses viewers in the experience, demonstrating the power of drama to illuminate even familiar events.

Its origins go back more than a century. There have been a series of wars between Israel and Arab nations. Uprisings - called intifadas - against Israeli occupation, and reprisals and crackdowns by Israel have also taken place. The consequences of the historic dispute over issues including land, borders and rights are still being felt, and include the latest war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. What was Israel before 1948 and how was it created? Britain took control of the area known as Palestine in World War One, following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which had ruled that part of the Middle East. An Arab majority and a Jewish minority lived there, as well as other ethnic groups. Tensions between the Jewish and Arab populations deepened when the UK agreed in principle to the establishment of a ""national home"" in Palestine for Jewish people - a pledge known as the Balfour Declaration. Jews had historical links to the land, but Palestinian Arabs also had a claim dating back centuries and opposed the move. The British said the rights of Palestinian Arabs already living there had to be protected. Getty Images Between the 1920s and 1940s the number of Jews arriving grew, with many fleeing persecution in Europe. The murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust gave added urgency to demands for a safe haven. The Jewish population reached 630,000, just over 30% of the population, by 1947. In 1947, against a backdrop of growing violence between Jews and Arabs - and against British rule - the United Nations (UN) voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states. Jerusalem would become an international city. No Arab nations supported this. They argued the plan gave the Jews more of the land, even though their population was smaller. Britain abstained. It decided to withdraw and to hand the problem to the UN at the end of 14 May 1948. Jewish leaders in Palestine declared an independent state known as Israel hours before British rule ended. Israel was recognised by the UN the following year. What was the 1948 Arab-Israeli war? The day after Israel declared independence, it was attacked and surrounded by the armies of five Arab nations. The conflict came to be known in Israel as its war of independence. Getty Images A Haganah (Jewish Underground) fighter just before the start of the Israeli war of independence in 1948 By the time the fighting ended with an armistice in 1949, Israel controlled most of the territory. Agreements left Egypt occupying the Gaza Strip, Jordan occupying the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Israel occupying West Jerusalem. About 750,000 Palestinians fled, or were forced from, their homes on land which became Israel and ended up as refugees. The event is known in Arabic as the Nakba (Catastrophe). Getty Images Arab Legion soldiers fire on fighters of the Haganah, the Jewish Agency self-defence force, in March 1948 In the years that followed, hundreds of thousands of Jews left, or were expelled from, Muslim majority countries across the Middle East and North Africa, with many going to Israel. What was the 1967 Middle East war? What is known as the Six-Day War changed boundaries in the Middle East and had major consequences for Palestinians. The war saw Israel fight Egypt, Syria and Jordan. It started when Israel, fearing an attack by Egypt and Syria, launched a strike on Egypt's air force. By the time the fighting ended, Israel had captured the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza from Egypt, most of the Golan Heights from Syria, and East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan. About a million Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem came under Israel's control. Getty Images Israeli military commanders arrive in East Jerusalem during the Six-Day War in 1967 Israel's occupation of these areas has lasted until this day. Israel signed a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 and returned the Sinai. It annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, making them part of Israel, although this has not been recognised by most of the international community. What is the status of the West Bank now? The West Bank - land between Israel and the River Jordan - is home to an estimated three million Palestinians. Along with East Jerusalem and Gaza, it is part of what are widely known as the Occupied Palestinian Territories. The Palestinians have always opposed Israel's presence in these areas and want them to be part of a future independent state, something backed by the vast majority of the international community. Israel still has overall control of the West Bank, but since the 1990s, a Palestinian government - known as the Palestinian Authority - has run most of its towns and cities. There are about 160 Israeli settlements, housing about 700,000 Jews, in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Palestinians want all Israeli settlements to be removed and they are considered illegal under international law. However, Israel's government disputes this. It says the biggest settlements at the very least are permanent and that all settlements are rooted in its historical rights. It does not recognise the right of the Palestinians to have their own state and argues that the West Bank is part of the Israeli homeland. The Israeli government announced plans to expand settlements after coming to power in 2022. It says the creation of a Palestinian state would be a threat to Israeli security. In July 2024, the top court of the UN, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), said that Israel's continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is illegal. It said that Israel should withdraw all settlers and that it was in breach of international agreements on racism and apartheid. There has been a sharp escalation in attacks by settlers against Palestinian villages since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. According to a report by the UN Office for Humanitarian Affairs, there were 2,208 attacks by settlers against Palestinians resulting in casualties or property damage between January 2024 and June 2025. Confronting violent settlers in the occupied West Bank Israel's borders explained in maps What is the dispute over Jerusalem? Israel and the Palestinians both claim Jerusalem as their capital. Israel, which already controlled West Jerusalem, occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 war and later declared the entire city its permanent capital. It says Jerusalem cannot be divided. The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. Most of the population of East Jerusalem is Palestinian, only a small minority of whom have chosen to become Israeli citizens. Getty Images Holy sites in Jerusalem are at the centre of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The most sacred site - known to Muslims as Al Aqsa Mosque compound, or Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and to Jews as Temple Mount - lies in East Jerusalem. The UN considers East Jerusalem to be Palestinian land occupied by Israel. What has happened in the Gaza Strip? The Gaza Strip is a stretch of land surrounded by Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. It is 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide. Home to about 2.1 million people, it is one of the most densely populated places on Earth. Even before the latest war between Israel and Hamas, Gaza had one of the highest unemployment rates in the world. Many people were living below the poverty line and depending on food aid to survive. Gaza's boundaries were drawn up as a result of the 1948 Middle East war, when it was occupied by Egypt. Egypt was driven out of Gaza in the 1967 war and the Strip was occupied by Israel, which built settlements and placed Gaza's Palestinian population under military rule. In 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza, though it retained control of its shared border, airspace and shoreline, giving it effective control of the movement of people and goods. The UN still regards Gaza as Israeli-occupied territory because of the level of control Israel has. Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006, and ejected its rivals from the territory after intense fighting the following year. Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade in response, with Israel controlling most of what was allowed into the territory. In the years that followed, Hamas and Israel fought several major conflicts - including those in 2008-09, 2012 and 2014. A major conflict between the two sides in May 2021 ended in a ceasefire after 11 days. Every round of fighting has seen people killed on both sides, the vast majority of them Palestinians in Gaza. Getty Images On 7 October 2023, Hamas fighters launched an assault from Gaza, killing about 1,200 people in Israel and taking 251 hostages. This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive, by land, sea and air. More than 61,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. In July, the UK and 27 other nations, including Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand and Switzerland called for an immediate end to the war. They said the suffering of civilians had ""reached new depths"". The same month, UN-backed experts warned the ""worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out"" in the Gaza Strip. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said there was mounting evidence that widespread starvation, malnutrition and disease were driving a rise in hunger-related deaths. UN agencies had already warned of man-made, mass starvation in Gaza. They have blamed the crisis on Israel, which controls the entry of all supplies to the territory. Israel has insisted that there are no restrictions on aid deliveries and that there is ""no starvation"". What we know about Israel's plan to take over Gaza City Famine 'currently playing out' in Gaza, UN-backed experts warn Israel levelling thousands of Gaza civilian buildings Which countries recognise a Palestinian state? The State of Palestine is currently recognised by 147 of the UN's 193 member states. Known as the State of Palestine at the UN, it has an official status of ""Permanent Observer State"", which gives it a seat but not a vote. Some countries, including the US, do not recognise a Palestinian state and have said they will only do so as part of a long-term political solution to the conflict in the Middle East. However, France, Belgium, Australia and Canada have all made announcements in support of recognising a Palestinian state at September's United Nations General Assembly. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said it would also recognise a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes ""substantive steps to end the appalling situation in Gaza"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said doing so would reward ""Hamas's monstrous terrorism"". Israel says it has a historical right to the West Bank and opposes an independent Palestinian state, saying it would pose an unacceptable threat. The Trump administration is against recognising a Palestinian state, arguing it would be a reward for Hamas and make it harder to end the war in Gaza. Why some Palestinians aren't convinced by Starmer's promise What does recognising a Palestinian state mean? What about Palestinian refugees? There are about 5.9 million Palestinians registered by the UN as refugees. They are descendants of the Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes on land which became Israel in the 1948-49 Middle East war. Most live in Jordan, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Syria and Lebanon. Palestinians insist on the right of refugees to return but Israel has refused this. It criticises the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, for allowing refugee status to be inherited by successive generations. What is Unrwa and why has Israel banned it? What is the two-state solution?","The Israel-Palestine conflict is a century-old struggle over land, borders, and national identity. It began under British rule, with tensions rising after the Balfour Declaration and Jewish migration. In 1948, Israel declared independence, leading to the Arab-Israeli war and displacement of around 750,000 Palestinians (Nakba). The 1967 Six-Day War expanded Israeli control over Gaza, West Bank, and East Jerusalem. Palestinians seek an independent state in these territories, but Israel maintains settlements and overall control. Gaza faces severe humanitarian crises under blockades and repeated conflicts with Israel, including the 2023 Hamas-Israel war. The international community remains divided on recognition, with 147 UN members recognizing Palestine, while Israel and some nations oppose it. Refugee rights and the two-state solution remain central issues.","इस्राइल-फिलिस्तीन संघर्ष भूमि, सीमाओं और राष्ट्रीय पहचान पर आधारित सदी पुराना विवाद है। ब्रिटिश शासन के दौरान यह शुरू हुआ, बाल्फ़ोर घोषणा और यहूदी प्रवासन के बाद तनाव बढ़ा। 1948 में इस्राइल के स्वतंत्र होने के बाद अरब-इस्राइली युद्ध हुआ और लगभग 7.5 लाख फिलिस्तीनियों का विस्थापन हुआ (नाकबा)। 1967 के छह-दिन के युद्ध ने गाज़ा, वेस्ट बैंक और पूर्वी यरुशलम पर इस्राइल का नियंत्रण बढ़ा दिया। फिलिस्तीनियों का लक्ष्य इन क्षेत्रों में स्वतंत्र राज्य बनाना है, लेकिन इस्राइल अब भी बस्तियाँ और व्यापक नियंत्रण रखता है। गाज़ा में इस्राइल के ब्लॉकड और युद्धों के कारण गंभीर मानवाधिकार संकट है, जिसमें 2023 का हमास-इस्राइल संघर्ष शामिल है। अंतरराष्ट्रीय समुदाय फिलिस्तीन को पहचानने में विभाजित है, 147 देशों ने इसे मान्यता दी है जबकि कुछ देश और इस्राइल विरोध करते हैं। शरणार्थियों के अधिकार और दो-राज्य समाधान अभी भी मुख्य मुद्दे हैं।",en,[],,The conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people is one of the longest-running in the world.,[''],www.bbc.com_culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He said prosecutors had failed to establish that there was enough evidence to justify the terrorism-related murder charges that they sought against Mangione. However, Judge Gregory Carro during a hearing on Tuesday morning ruled a charge of second-degree murder against Mangione could stand. A judge in New York state has dismissed two terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione, the alleged killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. In a written ruling, Carro said that the allegations against Mangione did not meet the definition of terrorism under state law. Although prosecutors argued that writings left by Mangione demonstrated a terrorism motive, the judge said they failed to show that the suspect intended to put political pressure on the government or terrorise the general population - key provisions of New York's terrorism law which was passed in the wake of the 11 September 2001 attacks. ""There was no evidence presented that the defendant made any demands of government or sought any particular governmental policy change, let alone that he did so by intimidation or coercion,"" Carro wrote in his ruling. The first-degree murder charge that was dismissed would have carried a maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. If convicted of the remaining second-degree murder charge, Mangione faces a minimum sentence of 15 to 25 years in prison. He has also been charged with weapons and forgery crimes. And in addition to the New York state criminal proceedings, Mangione also faces federal murder charges, which could lead to the death penalty. Carro rejected the defence team's request to delay the state trial until the conclusion of Mangione's federal trial. During the hearing on Tuesday the judge ruled that trial hearings would begin on 1 December. Mangione has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him. Thompson, a father of two, was the chief executive of the insurance division of UnitedHealth Group - the largest health insurer in the US. He was in New York City for a meeting when he was shot three times on a busy Manhattan street at around 6:45 a.m. on 4 December. After a five-day manhunt, Mangione was arrested about 300 miles (480km) away, at a McDonald's restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania. Police said he left a note criticising companies profiting from the US health care system, accusing them of ""corruption and greed"". Outside the Manhattan Supreme Court on Tuesday a handful of Mangione's supporters gathered, some of them holding placards with slogans such as ""Free Luigi"" and ""Innocent until proven guilty"".","A New York judge dismissed terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione, accused of the December 2023 murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on a Manhattan street.  While Judge Gregory Carro found insufficient evidence to link the shooting to a terrorism motive, as required by state law, a second-degree murder charge remains.  Prosecutors argued Mangione's writings indicated a terrorist intent, but the judge stated no evidence showed attempts to pressure the government or terrorize the public.  The dismissed terrorism charges carried a potential life sentence without parole; the second-degree murder charge carries a minimum of 15-25 years.  Mangione, who pleaded not guilty, also faces federal murder charges (potentially resulting in the death penalty) and separate state charges related to weapons, forgery, and the alleged 2011 murder of his wife and two children.  He is currently out on bail and his state trial begins December 1st, expected to last two weeks.  Thompson, a father of two, was shot three times during a business trip.  Mangione was apprehended following a five-day manhunt.

JLR has dismissed reports that the operational impact of the attack may continue for weeks or months as ""speculation"". The hack, which occurred more than two weeks ago, forced JLR to shut down its IT networks and paralysed production. A criminal investigation is under way. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has told suppliers that production at its factories will not resume until 24 September at the earliest following a serious cyber attack, but industry sources have warned disruption could last into November. The shutdown is believed to be costing the company at least £50m a week in lost production. JLR would normally expect to build more than 1,000 cars a day. The firm, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, has car plants in Solihull and Halewood, as well as an engine facility in Wolverhampton. It also has large factories in Slovakia and China, as well as a smaller facility in India. But all of the production lines have been at a standstill since 1 September when the hack first came to light. Announcing the latest delay, JLR said: ""We have taken this decision as our forensic investigation of the cyber incident continues and as we consider the different stages of the controlled restart of our global operations, which will take time. ""We are very sorry for the continued disruption this incident is causing and we will continue to update as the investigation progresses."" JLR initially appeared confident that the situation would be resolved quickly. However, it has since become clear that restarting production is not a simple process. The company has admitted some data may have been viewed or stolen by third parties as a result of the cyber attack. By 24 September, three and a half weeks of output will have been lost. Industry insiders say that even once the production lines have restarted, getting back to normal output is likely to take several weeks. Among suppliers, many of whom are small and medium sized businesses, there is growing concern. Several have told the BBC they simply do not have the financial resources to cope with an extended shutdown and industry experts have said bankruptcies are likely, unless some kind of support is provided. Jason Richards, West Midlands regional officer at Unite the union, told the BBC: ""We're already seeing employers having discussions on potential redundancies. People have to pay rent, they have to pay mortgages and if they're not getting any pay, what are they supposed to do? ""We need to have a supply chain into Jaguar Land Rover. I can't emphasise it enough [because] if they turn the tap on and they're expecting the supply chain to be waiting on the subs bench, they won't be there,"" he added.","Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) faces significant production disruption extending potentially into November following a major cyberattack that began on September 1st.  The attack forced the shutdown of all production lines at its UK and global facilities, costing the company an estimated £50 million per week in lost production.  While JLR initially downplayed the impact, the company now acknowledges a controlled restart isn't expected until at least September 24th, representing a loss of over three and a half weeks of output.  Industry experts warn a full return to normal production could take several more weeks, even after the restart.  The prolonged shutdown has sparked serious concerns among JLR's suppliers, many of whom are small and medium-sized businesses facing potential bankruptcy without financial support.  Union officials have already reported discussions regarding potential redundancies, highlighting the widespread impact of the cyberattack on the automotive industry and its supply chain. A criminal investigation into the attack is underway.

In a statement, the police said the suspects were in custody and would be formally charged. They have not commented since their arrest. In the post several young men are seen dancing to a remix of a campaign song originally used during the president's election bid in 2022, but with the lyrics altered to include derogatory language. Police in Somalia have arrested four TikTokers for allegedly insulting President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud in a dance video. In August last year, seven TikTokers were sentenced to six months in prison by a court in the capital, Mogadishu, for provoking civil unrest and spreading immorality. The authorities said the behaviour in the recent video - the original of which has been deleted but it still being widely shared on TikTok and other social media platforms - constituted a criminal offence under Somali law. Police spokesman Gen Abdifatah Aden warned the public that anyone engaging in similar acts that disrespected national institutions or leaders would ""face the full force of the law"". The arrests have reignited public debate over the role of social media in Somalia, particularly TikTok, which has been at the centre of controversy in the past. Some have expressed their support for the young men while others have defended the arrests, saying freedom of expression should not extend to such levels - particularly in a country still grappling with fragile governance. TikTok is a popular platform in Somalia and within the large diaspora - especially among the youth, who use it for political commentary and satire. Many people also use it for business as well as a source of entertainment. In 2023, the government considered banning the platform altogether, citing concerns over national security, the spread of misinformation and the erosion of social and moral values. The ban was not implemented at the time because of strong public opposition, but officials warned that the platform was increasingly being used to spread harmful content including extremist propaganda and defamatory material.","Four TikTokers in Somalia were arrested and later released on bail for allegedly insulting President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud in a dance video featuring altered lyrics of a campaign song.  Police warned of strict enforcement against those disrespecting national leaders on social media, citing a previous case where seven TikTokers received six-month prison sentences for similar offenses. While the original video has been deleted, it continues to circulate online.  The arrests have sparked debate about freedom of expression versus national security concerns in Somalia, where TikTok is a popular platform used for both entertainment and political commentary.

As people lined up to vote on Tuesday, frustrated motorists continued to form long, snaking queues for fuel outside petrol stations. President Chakwera, who has promised to tackle this shortage, stood in line to vote with local residents at his home village, Malembo, which is about 56km (35 miles) north-east of capital city Lilongwe. Several police officers and military guards watched over the 70-year-old and his wife, as voters huddled around, hoping to catch a peek of their president. The election is effectively a two-horse race between Chakwera and the man he beat in 2020, 85-year-old Mutharika. However, there are 15 other candidates, including another former president, and the country's only female head of state, Joyce Banda. A couple of hours before the polls closed, Malawi Electoral Commission chairperson Annabel Mtalimanja said 3.7 million people - just half of those who had registered to vote - had cast their ballot. For the most part, voting progressed smoothly the stations, which totalled more than 15,000. However, news agency Reuters reported delays at some stations due to problems with biometric fingerprint readers. The electoral commission acknowledged ""queueing challenges"" at ""one or two centres"", but said these issues were managed. Provisions were made for voters that could not write - they marked their ballot paper with an inked fingerprint, while others used a pen to select their chosen candidate. Prior to the polls opening, Ms Mtalimanja reminded social media influencers not to livestream or document of themselves voting, as Malawians are prohibited from taking pictures of their ballot papers. The counting of votes began once the polls closed at 14:00 GMT. The Malawi Electoral Commission has up until the end of 24 September to announce the presidential result in Tuesday's poll and the end of 30 September for the parliamentary election.","Malawi's presidential election, dominated by economic woes, concluded Tuesday with a close race between incumbent Lazarus Chakwera and his main rival, former president Peter Mutharika.  While 17 candidates competed, the election effectively became a two-horse race.  Millions of Malawians, facing soaring food prices (up over 30% in a year), fuel shortages, and widespread power outages, cast their ballots, hoping for economic relief.  Voter turnout was approximately 50% of registered voters, with some polling stations experiencing delays due to technical issues.  Although voting largely proceeded smoothly, long fuel queues underscored the country's economic struggles.  The results, expected by September 24th, will determine whether Chakwera secures a second term or if a runoff between him and Mutharika is necessary.  Public anger over the economic crisis was palpable, with voters expressing a strong desire for change.

He described it as a ""cheap shot"" after Matthew O'Toole asked him to confirm whether a ""large proportion"" of the minister's speech ""was written by AI"". The minister, who was delivering a statement on special educational needs (SEN) provision, said it was an ""utterly shameful"" contribution by the opposition.

Givan dismissed the claim as a ""cheap shot"" and an ""utterly shameful"" contribution, arguing he was focusing on securing £1.7bn in ring-fenced capital funding for SEN provision.  While the Department of Education denied AI involvement, the SDLP stated it would be investigating the use of AI within the executive, acknowledging both the potential benefits and risks of the technology.

The competition saw composer Yasushi Akimoto, whose songs have collectively sold more than 100 million copies, go head-to-head with an ""AI Akimoto"" trained on his writing style. They each composed a new song for AKB48 as the group celebrated their 20th anniversary. Fans were presented with both tracks and asked to vote for their favourite. The results were announced live on Japanese TV - with the AI song, Omoide Scroll, winning by more than 3,000 votes. ""What? You're kidding me!"" Akimoto responded as the scores were revealed. Nippon TV The AI song was crowned the winner after a five-day online vote The song has now been uploaded to streaming services as AKB48's 67th official single. The real Akimoto's song, called Cécile, has been deleted from YouTube. The Japanese music industry will be watching closely to see how fans react to Omoide Scroll, now they know it was machine-generated. Japan's Oricon singles chart will provide the ultimate litmus test - as AKB48's last 53 songs have gone to number one. If their new record breaks that streak, it may be regarded as a rejection of the technology. EMI/Universal Japan The band's seventh album, Nantettatte AKB48, topped the Japanese charts last December Yasushi Akimoto is one of the most prominent writers and idol-makers in Japanese pop, and was once called the ""Steve Jobs of otaku"" - a Japanese term for people with an obsessive interest in a specific hobby such as anime or video games. He is responsible for creating chart-topping bands including Onyanko Club, AKB48 and their various spin-offs; and is a professor at the Kyoto University of Art and Design. For the AI songwriting contest, Google's Gemini software was trained on Akimoto's writing style, including essays, vocabulary and songwriting techniques. It then generated the lyrics for a new song and chose which of AKB48's members (there are 43 in total) would perform the lyrics and choreography. The song itself was completed and arranged by humans, although some Japanese media reports say the AI software was also responsible for the melody. Akimoto followed the same process, and the two songs were put to a public vote, without revealing which was which. The entries were: Cécile. Written by Akimoto, it is a Motown pastiche with a French twist. The lyrics describe a girl's obsession with her female best friend: "" I copy the way you style your hair / Please don't notice my love for you .""

At school, he became part of a street gang and was arrested for ""borrowing an automobile that had stolen jewellery in its trunk"". He won a scholarship to the University of Colorado thanks to his prowess at baseball, but was thrown out after 18 months for drunkenness. At the same time, his mother died - aged just 40. Stricken with grief, he drifted for a while, finding work in the Californian oilfields - before travelling to Paris and Florence, where he studied art. His sojourn in Europe encouraged him to take a fresh approach to the United States: ""I began to look at my country from another point of view,"" he later said. Returning home, he enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Art with ambitions to become a theatrical designer - but quickly switched to acting. Like many actors in late 1950s New York, he picked up a number of small roles on stage and television, including parts in popular series such as The Untouchables, Perry Mason and Dr Kildare. Getty Images The 1965 film Inside Daisy Clover, opposite Natalie Wood, was a breakthrough for Redford His big-screen debut came in 1960 with a minor role in Tall Story, where he found himself working alongside Jane Fonda. It was not an auspicious start to his film career. The film flopped - with Time magazine opining that ""nothing can save this picture"". However, it did mark the beginning of a lifetime's friendship with Fonda, who later admitted to falling in love with him each time they worked together. Getty Images With Jane Fonda in Barefoot in the Park. Fonda said he had an aura about him ""There was always a mystery because he didn't reveal anything. He's got an aura about him,"" she said. His first major stage success was as pompous lawyer Paul Bratter in Neil Simon's romantic comedy Barefoot in the Park. It was a role he would reprise in the 1967 film version, opposite Fonda. In 1965, he picked up a Golden Globe award for most promising newcomer for his role in the film Inside Daisy Clover with Natalie Wood. But he was turned down for the part of Benjamin Braddock in The Graduate because director Mike Nichols felt he was too good-looking - which made Redford wary of being stereotyped by his appearance. Getty Images Paul Newman and Robert Redford formed one of Hollywood's great screen partnerships Global fame came in 1969 with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The 33-year-old's portrayal of the laidback Kid, in contrast to Paul Newman's fast-talking Butch, proved to be one of Hollywood's great partnerships. Ironically, Redford nearly missed out on the part after one studio executive said: ""He's just another Hollywood blond. Throw a stick out of a window in Malibu, you'll hit six like him."" The studio did everything it could to avoid hiring Redford, until Newman - a huge established star - stepped in and insisted. The two actors found they shared a love of theatre, and remained firm friends until Newman's death in 2008. Getty Images Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford in All the President's Men, the story of the Washington Post's reporting on the Watergate scandal ""We'd play tricks on each other,"" Redford said of his relationship with Newman. ""The more sophisticated the joke the better."" In 1973, their natural on-screen chemistry saw them team up again in The Sting. Redford was Oscar-nominated for his role as Johnny Hooker, a small-time grifter who joins forces with Newman's character to swindle a vicious crime boss. The film, with its distinctive ragtime soundtrack, eventually won seven Academy Awards including best picture - although Redford was beaten to the best actor award by Jack Lemmon. It was the only time Redford was ever nominated in the best actor category at the Oscars, although he would later win as a director - and received an honorary Oscar in 2002. Getty Images With Barbra Streisand in the comedy-drama, The Way We Were Redford's acting roles were prolific throughout the 70s, although there were mixed reviews for his turn as the enigmatic Gatsby in The Great Gatsby, and he was overshadowed by Barbra Streisand in The Way We Were. But in 1974, Redford bought the film rights to All the President's Men, an account of the Watergate scandal by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein - the two Washington Post reporters who uncovered it. ""The Washington Post were very nervous about us - that this was Hollywood and it could hurt them,"" he recalled. Released in 1976, with Redford playing Woodward alongside Dustin Hoffman as Bernstein, the film was a critical success, winning four Oscars - including best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor for Jason Robards. Four years on, and Redford made his directorial debut with 1980's Ordinary People, a study of the collapse of a middle-class family after the death of one of their sons. It won him his first and only Oscar. Getty Images Redford as the mysterious Great Gatsby in the 1974 film adaptation of F Scott Fitzgerald's novel With recognition came wealth. Redford used much of his earnings to buy a ski resort in Utah, his wife Lola's home state, which he renamed Sundance after one of his most famous roles. Around the same time, he founded the Sundance Institute to provide creative and financial support to independent film-makers. He went on to become chairman of the Utah/US Film Festival, later renamed the Sundance Film Festival. Over time, the festival became a key event in the film calendar, showcasing the work of many directors who went on to become household names, including Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh. In acting terms, there were hits and misses over the last two decades of the 20th Century. Prison drama Brubaker was a commercial and critical success, and there was a positive reception for popular dramas The Horse Whisperer and Indecent Proposal. Out of Africa won a fistful of awards, but Havana was badly received and lost money at the box office. Simultaneously, Redford continued to direct, including A River Runs Through It - which gave a career boost to a fledgling Brad Pitt - and The Legend of Bagger Vance, the last film to feature Jack Lemmon. Getty Images Robert Redford and his second wife, Sibylle Szaggars, in 2015 There was a muted reception for Lions for Lambs, which saw him reunited with Out of Africa's Meryl Streep. There was high praise, however, for his role in the groundbreaking All is Lost - about an elderly yachtsman alone on his damaged boat in the Indian Ocean. ""There's no dialogue, none at all. And I'm the only actor on screen in the whole movie,"" Redford said. Many critics described his performance as the best of his career. He also starred as S.H.I.E.L.D agent Alexander Pierce in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, a film far removed from his usual fare. ""I like the idea of stepping into new territory,"" he told the LA Times, in 2013. ""This is the kind of film I would love to have seen as a kid."" Away from the studio, Redford became a prominent advocate for the environment. ""Ours is a sick planet because of our behaviour on it,"" he said in a 2014 interview. Getty Images Robert Redford founded the Sundance Festival, which supported the careers of independent film makers Redford married Lola Van Wagenen in 1958, and the couple had four children. Their youngest, Scott, died of sudden infant death syndrome aged two months. In interviews, Redford said he believed that karma had punished him for possessing sexual magnetism and leading the hedonistic life of an actor. ""It felt like retribution,"" he says. ""I always had this thing that death was on my shoulder, 24/7. My dogs, as a kid. My mum. My firstborn."" The couple divorced in 1985, and Redford had lengthy romances with Brazilian actress Sonia Braga and costume assistant Kathy O'Rear. He married Sibylle Szaggars - a German-born artist - in 2009. In 2020, his son, David, died in his fifties from complications of bile duct cancer. He had been ill since birth and had had two liver transplants. In 2019, Redford announced his retirement from acting soon after his cameo in Avengers: Endgame. But he found it hard to leave the limelight. Approaching the age of 90, he reversed his decision a few years later - to appear in several episodes of Dark Winds, the story of two Navajo police officers who try to solve a double murder. Getty Images Robert Redford photographed at the age of 84","Robert Redford, the iconic actor and director, died at age 89.  His career spanned over 50 films, showcasing his all-American looks and undeniable charisma, though he himself considered his beauty a hindrance.

He achieved critical acclaim and an Oscar for Best Director with *Ordinary People* (1980).  Redford's legacy extends beyond acting; he founded the Sundance Institute, a crucial platform for independent filmmakers, and the Sundance Film Festival.

Cardiff University medical student Lily McGarry, from Jersey, believed she was experiencing a bout of ""freshers' flu"". But after being taken to hospital, the 24-year-old suffered two heart attacks and fell into a coma, with the next three months a complete blank. The life-threatening condition, where the body's response to an infection damages tissues and organs is not yet clearly understood and can affect anyone, of any age, according to the UK Sepsis Trust. ""When you're young you think, as I did, that these kind of conditions don't affect you,"" said Lily. ""You feel a bit invincible, and you don't want to worry about your health because you've got a social life to live."" Described by her friends as ""a fantastic sportswoman"", Lily was passionate about swimming, running and being at the beach. But as she lies in her bed at Cardiff's Llandough Hospital, she remembers the day her normal student lifestyle was turned upside down, and contemplates how she can return to an active lifestyle. ""I felt a bit under the weather, but I was still going about my daily life,"" she said. ""I was sat at home with my housemates at uni. ""Then I watched Gavin and Stacey all day sat on the sofa."" This was on 14 January, and she decided to go to bed at about 23:00, adding: ""I just thought I'd have a rest and sleep it off."" Family handout Lily took part in triathlons as part of a very active lifestyle, which included swimming and running regularly But as the night went on, Lily's condition deteriorated. She added: ""My housemate saw my light was still on when she got up in the night, and came to see me. ""I was sick everywhere and had been incontinent."" Her friends Lucy and Ella cleaned her up and took her to A&E, at which point she noticed a rash that was starting to spread on her body. Lily was taken to the resuscitation area, and was still not fully aware of the seriousness of her condition, adding: ""I was able to walk into A&E and so at that point I thought I'd just receive some antibiotics and go home the next day. ""But in resus I remember the consultant asking for my mum and dad's mobile numbers."" Apart from being in a room surrounded by doctors and nurses, she remembers very little after this, until about three months later in April. Lily did not even know she had suffered a cardiac arrest, and describes it as ""quite surreal"" finding out about this from a post her sister had written. ""I don't think I really realised the scale of what had happened until about May when I was starting to look at my body,"" she added. ""I've been told I quickly went into septic shock. ""My blood pressure was very low and within 24 hours I'd had two cardiac arrests and was diagnosed with meningococcal septicaemia."" Lily is recovering at Llandough Hospital after sepsis completely changed her life What is sepsis? Sepsis occurs when the body responds improperly to infection, causing the organs to work poorly. It can cause a dramatic drop in blood pressure and damage the lungs, kidneys, liver and other organs. According to UK Sepsis Trust, one of the key challenges in identifying sepsis is that it can present very differently in each patient. There are six key symptoms to look out for: S - slurred speech or confusion E - extreme pain in muscles and joints P - passing no urine in a day S - severe breathlessness I - people saying ""it feels like I'm going to die"" S - skin that's mottled, discoloured or very pale Megan McDonagh Lily is positive about the future and is contemplating how she can get back to an active sporting life ""I'm fortunate to have lost my limbs in an age where there's lots of technology,"" Lily said. She is considering devices such as hand cycles, adding: ""I've always liked swimming and being in the water and I'm really excited about the sense of freedom I'll have without gravity in the water. ""So I hope that can happen soon."" Lily will head back to Jersey in November, and is looking forward to seeing her grandparents, going to the beach and to ""recuperate and reflect on what's happened"". Ella Jennings Ella Jennings (left) said her friend Lily McGarry (centre) was the most selfless person she had ever met Friends and family are also raising money to help give her as many opportunities as possible, and she describes feeling emotional about support from Wales, Jersey and further afield. Housemate Ella Jennings described how compassionate and caring she is, and how Lily would go out of her way to help others. ""Since she's got poorly she's just that and more, she's so positive,"" Ella added. ""Every time I see her she's making more progress and thinking about the future, she's so determined. She's still the same Lily asking about everyone else and caring about everyone else. ""Honestly she blows my mind, every time I see her, she astounds me with her attitude and her outlook on life.""","Cardiff University student Lily McGarry, 24, nearly died from sepsis after initially dismissing her symptoms as ""fresher's flu.""  The illness led to two heart attacks, a three-month coma, and the amputation of her limbs.  Despite this, McGarry, a former triathlete, remains remarkably positive and is already planning her return to an active life using adaptive equipment. Friends and family are raising funds to support her recovery.  McGarry's case highlights the dangers of sepsis, a life-threatening condition where the body's response to infection damages its own tissues and organs.  The UK Sepsis Trust emphasizes the importance of recognizing its varied symptoms, including slurred speech, extreme pain, lack of urination, severe breathlessness, and a feeling of impending death.

He referenced his achievements from his breakout movies to receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom. ""Growing up working-class in Santa Monica, I faced setbacks flunking out of college, losing my mom young. I hustled through small TV roles, learned on Broadway, and took risks directing and building Sundance. Personal losses, like my son Scott's death, taught me resilience. It was grit, passion, and a love for art that got me here."" He added: ""I'm thrilled my films, from The Sting to A River Runs Through It, have moved you, sparked conversations, or brought comfort. Sundance has given new filmmakers a voice, and my environmental work has inspired some to care for our planet. Your support makes it all worthwhile, thank you for being part of my journey."" It was 1969's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, a Western film about two bank robbers, co-starring Paul Newman, that made Redford an overnight star. But despite his success, Redford was never comfortable with his tag as a good-looking heartthrob. ""People have been so busy relating to how I look, it's a miracle I didn't become a self-conscious blob of protoplasm. It's not easy being Robert Redford,"" he once told New York magazine. He teamed up again with Newman for crime caper The Sting in 1973, also considered a classic.

Films that premiered at Sundance and went onto huge success include Four Weddings and a Funeral, Precious, Manchester by the Sea, Little Miss Sunshine, The Blair Witch Project and Get Out. In 2014, Redford spoke with the BBC about the festival - saying at the time: ""I didn't want to do it in New York or LA [...] I said, let's put it in Utah, let's make it hard to get to. Let's make it weird. ""We started Sundance as a place to come and develop new artists, with the ambition of creating a community and giving them a platform for their work. I don't think our mission has changed at all,"" he explained. ""Thirty years ago, these people had nowhere to go. Now I'm very proud that actually, the directors of Gravity and American Hustle - Alfonso Cuaron and David O Russell - actually came up through Sundance, and now they work in the mainstream."" Many of the films that make it to the Oscars were helped by Sundance along the way. ""Our film, Coda, came to the attention of everyone because of Sundance,"" wrote actress Marlee Matlin on X, who starred in the film. ""Sundance happened because of Robert Redford.

""We have a deal on TikTok, I've reached a deal with China, I'm going to speak to President Xi on Friday to confirm everything up,"" Trump told reporters as he left the White House for a state visit to the UK. The social media platform, which is run by Chinese company ByteDance, was told it had to sell its US operations or risk being shut down. However, Trump has repeatedly delayed the ban since it was first announced in January. The US president said a buyer will be announced soon. CNBC reported the deal would include a mix of current and new investors, and would be completed in the next 30 to 45 days. It also said US tech company Oracle would keep its existing agreement to host TikTok serves inside the US. That had been one of the main concerns of American lawmakers, who cited concerns over data being shared with China on national security grounds. On Monday, a US trade delegation said it had reached a ""framework"" deal with China amid wider trade negotiations in Madrid. China confirmed a framework agreement but said no deal would be made at the expense of their firms' interests. After the talks, Wang Jingtao, deputy head of China's cyberspace administration, suggested in a press conference the agreement included ""licensing the algorithm and other intellectual property rights"". He added: ""The Chinese government will, according to law, examine and approve relevant matters involving TikTok, such as the export of technology as well as the license use of intellectual property.""","President Trump announced a deal to keep TikTok operating in the US, resolving a months-long standoff with China.  The agreement, reached after intense negotiations and several delayed deadlines, involves a sale of TikTok's US operations to a yet-to-be-named buyer, likely including a mix of existing and new investors.  Oracle will reportedly continue its role hosting TikTok's US data servers.  While Trump stated the deal is complete pending a Friday confirmation call with President Xi,  China confirmed only a framework agreement, emphasizing that no deal would compromise its national interests.

A government spokesperson said: ""We are still the only country to benefit from a 25% tariff on steel exports to the US, reinforcing our position as a trusted source of high-quality steel."" Tariffs of 25% are currently applied to steel exports to the US, which make up 6% of all UK steel exports by volume and 9% by value. The BBC understands that a proposed deal to eliminate tariffs on UK steel exports to the US has been put on hold indefinitely. However, an agreement to reduce them to zero in short order was welcomed with some fanfare at the time by the government and the industry in July. At the time the 25% tariff was first imposed, steel executives described the move as ""devastating"". However, industry sources told the BBC today that while the news was disappointing, the UK still enjoyed a comparative advantage over other producers who face 50%. One added that it at least gave the industry some certainty in a world where a surplus of cheap steel was causing many countries to erect trade barriers to protect their domestic industry. Gareth Stace from UK Steel said the UK should do the same. ""It is even more imperative now that the UK government beefs up its own trade defences to ensure UK steelmakers have a sustainable share of their own market. In these market conditions, the last country to protect their industry will be the first to lose it,"" he said. A government spokesperson said: ""We are continuing to work closely with the US to deliver certainty for UK industry, protect skilled jobs and support economic growth as part of our Plan for Change."" Andrew Griffith, the shadow business and trade secretary, criticised Prime Minister Keir Starmer over the development. ""The Prime Minister claimed credit for negotiating steel tariffs to zero,"" he said. Hopes of a hasty deal to remove tariffs completely hit snags as US officials raised questions about the exports from the UKL's largest steel maker Tata, which has shut down its blast furnaces - meaning that steel is not made from scratch in the UK - pending the completion of new Electric Arc furnaces due to be completed in 2027. The steel industry in the UK is in considerable financial distress, which has seen the government take over running Chinese-owned plants in Scunthorpe while Liberty Steel plants in Rotherham and Stocksbridge collapsed into government control last month.","Hopes for a zero-tariff deal on UK steel exports to the US have been dashed, leaving the UK with a 25% tariff – better than the 50% imposed on other countries.  While disappointing, industry sources suggest the 25% tariff still provides a competitive advantage amidst a global steel surplus and rising trade barriers.  The UK government maintains it's working with the US to secure long-term certainty for the industry, which is facing considerable financial distress, including plant closures and government interventions.  However, the opposition criticized the government for previously claiming credit for a zero-tariff deal that ultimately failed to materialize.  The UK steel industry now calls for the government to implement its own trade protections to safeguard the sector's future.

The call came after Machar - currently under house arrest - was charged with murder, treason and crimes against humanity. His party, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement In Opposition (SPLM-IO), has denounced he charges as a ""political witch-hunt"" to ""dismantle"" a 2018 peace accord that ended a five-year civil war. Meanwhile, extra troops from neighbouring Ugandan have been deployed to South Sudan's capital, Juba, as tensions escalate. The latest crisis comes as a UN report has accused South Sudanese officials of stealing billions of dollars in oil revenues, leaving millions of people without essential services and fuelling the deadly conflict. What's the background? South Sudan, one of the world's poorest countries, gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after decades of struggle led by the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) under President Salva Kiir. Just two years into independence, a civil war erupted when Kiir dismissed Machar as vice-president, accusing him of plotting a coup. The ensuing conflict, largely fought along ethnic lines between supporters of the two leaders, resulted in an estimated 400,000 deaths and 2.5 million people being forced from their homes - more than a fifth of the population. As part of the peace deal, Machar was reinstated as vice-president within a unity government that was meant to pave the way for elections. Why is there tension now? AFP Riek Machar (L) and Salva Kiir (R) - seen here together in 2020 - had been allies within the SPLM before falling out The current crisis was sparked at the beginning of March when the White Army militia, which was allied to Machar during the civil war, clashed with the army in Upper Nile state and overran a military base in Nasir. Then on 7 March a UN helicopter attempting to evacuate troops came under fire, leaving several dead, including a high-ranking army general. Nearly three weeks later, Machar and several of his associates were placed under house arrest. They were accused of trying to stir up a rebellion. ""The prospect for peace and stability in South Sudan has now been put into serious jeopardy,"" Oyet Nathaniel Pierino, deputy leader of SPLM-IO, said at the time. Rather than defusing tensions, the government struck again, hitting Machar with a slew of charges - including treason, the ultimate crime against the state - in September. Days later, his party ratcheted up the pressure, denouncing Kiir's government as a ""dictatorship"" and demanding ""regime change"". In what appeared to be a call to arms, it urged its supporters to ""report for national service"" and to use ""all means available to regain their country and sovereignty"". However, there are no reports to suggest that troop mobilisation is under way, offering a glimmer of hope that fresh fighting will not erupt. Helicopter pilot recounts flying under gunfire in daring rescue mission What about the 2018 peace deal? While Machar's inclusion in the unity government was a key part of the agreement, other parts of it have not been implemented. The key issue for many South Sudanese is the security arrangement. The deal outlined how former rebel forces and government soldiers would be brought together into a unified national army made up of 83,000 troops. The remainder were supposed to be disarmed and demobilised. But this has not happened and there are still lots of militias aligned to different political groups. The deal also outlined the establishment, with the help of the African Union, of a court meant to try the perpetrators of the violence. But this has not been created, in part because those holding some of the top positions in government are reluctant to set up something that could see them put on trial. Elections that were supposed to happen in 2022 have still not taken place and neither has a new constitution been drawn up. How has corruption affected the situation? A report by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan has accused the country's political elite of siphoning off billions of dollars in oil revenue. Published on Tuesday, the 101-page dossier - Plundering a Nation: How Rampant Corruption Unleashed a Human Rights Crisis in South Sudan - documented how the government had collected more than $25.2bn (£18.4bn) in oil revenues since independence in 2011, but most of this had been systematically misappropriated, depriving millions of South Sudanese of food, medicine, education and security. One section highlighted how the government's controversial ""Oil for Roads"" programme, funnelled an estimated $2.2bn into areas of political patronage rather than roadbuilding. Yasmin Sooka, chair of the commission, said corruption had become the ""engine of South Sudan's decline"". ""Billions meant for healthcare and schools are disappearing through opaque deals and shell companies,"" she warned. Justice Minister Joseph Geng Akech dismissed the findings and attributed South Sudan's economic problems to conflict, climate change and falling sales of crude oil. What is the problem between Machar and Kiir? While Kiir and Machar, both in their 70s, were part of the SPLM that fought for independence, long-standing tensions exist. These have been fuelled by ethnic divisions - Kiir is Dinka, while Machar is Nuer - and competing political ambitions. When Kiir sacked Machar in 2013, triggering the civil war, Machar denounced him as a ""dictator"". Creating further problems between the two are the repeated postponements of elections. Polls have been delayed four times, leaving Machar unable to fulfil his presidential ambitions while perceptions grow that Kiir intends to be president-for-life. Who is Riek Machar? Born in 1952, the 72-year-old was the 27th son of the chief of Ayod and Leer and was brought up in the Presbyterian Church. As an undergraduate, he studied mechanical engineering at the University of Khartoum and in 1984 earned a PhD in philosophy and strategic planning at the UK's Bradford University. He switched sides on several occasions during the battle to secede from Sudan, as he sought to strengthen his position and that of his Nuer ethnic group. He became vice-president of South Sudan at independence in 2011. Machar was sacked in 2013 and then reinstated as part of a deal in 2016, but then fled as fighting resumed. Who is Salva Kiir? Born in 1951, the 74-year-old devout Roman Catholic was the son of a cattle herder and the eighth of nine children. At 17, he joined the Anyanya, one of the rebel groups that was fighting for southern independence during the First Sudanese Civil War in 1967. Sixteen years later - in the Second Sudanese Civil War - he was one of the five founding members of the Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement. The former rebel commander, who specialised in military intelligence, was seen as a moderate within the SPLM and became its leader in 2005 after the death of John Garang in a helicopter crash He became president of South Sudan on independence and has remained in that position for 14 years as no elections have taken place. How bad could things get? In March, Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN mission in South Sudan, warned the country was ""teetering on the brink of a return to full-scale civil war"", which would devastate the nation that is still dealing with the aftermath of the last conflict. There are concerns that a return to fighting could lead to ""proxy warfare in the region"", according to Daniel Akech, an analyst at the Crisis Group think-tank. ""South Sudan is filled with so many armed groups, they're all seeming to be gearing up for military engagement."" The war in neighbouring Sudan adds another element of instability. The leaders of the members of the regional grouping Igad - including Uganda - are supposed to be the guarantors of the 2018 deal. Some Ugandan troops were deployed to the country in March as part of what South Sudan's government said was a long-standing agreement to support the army. This week, a convoy carrying additional Ugandan troops were spotted entering Juba on Monday afternoon. It included seven lorries full of heavily armed soldiers, three armoured vehicles and an ambulance - all without number plates. This additional contingent of Ugandan soldiers has raised concerns that Machar's trial might turn violent. Over the weekend Machar met with his defence team ahead of his trial which is due to start soon - though no date has been confirmed.

Machar, currently under house arrest, faces accusations including murder, treason, and crimes against humanity, prompting his party, the SPLM-IO, to call for ""regime change"" and denounce the charges as a political witch-hunt aimed at undermining the 2018 peace agreement.  This escalation comes amidst a UN report revealing billions of dollars in stolen oil revenue, exacerbating the country's already dire humanitarian crisis.  The situation is further inflamed by recent clashes between Machar's allied militia and the army, as well as the deployment of additional Ugandan troops to Juba, raising fears of regional escalation.  The 2018 peace deal, which included Machar's reinstatement as vice-president, has largely remained unimplemented, with key provisions regarding security arrangements and the establishment of a transitional justice mechanism stalled.  Long-standing tensions between Machar and President Salva Kiir, fueled by ethnic divisions and political ambitions, coupled with delayed elections, have significantly contributed to the current crisis, threatening to unravel years of fragile peace and plunging the already impoverished nation back into widespread violence.

In four of the cases, the car owners resorted to breaking the window to resolve the issue. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Tuesday that it had received nine complaints about the handles in Tesla's 2021 Model Y cars, the company's flagship model. US safety regulators have opened a probe focused on Tesla's electric-powered door handles, responding to reports that they suddenly stopped working, leaving children trapped in the cars. NHTSA said its preliminary review found that the problem appeared to occur when the electric locks received insufficient voltage. The owners who have reported the incidents - most of whom were parents trying to get their children out of the back seat after stepping out their car - said they had received no warning about battery problems prior to the incidents. Though the doors can technically be opened from the inside, children may be unable to reach or access the manual handles, NHTSA said. ""In these instances, an occupant who remains inside a vehicle in this condition may be unable to be rapidly retrieved by persons outside of the vehicle,"" the safety regulator said in its initial review. ""Entrapment in a vehicle is particularly concerning in emergency situations, such as when children are entrapped in a hot vehicle,"" NHTSA added. The investigation into the scope and severity of the issue will involve an examination of roughly 170,000 Model Y vehicles, the regulator said. The latest investigation is not Tesla's first NHTSA probe. The regulator is also looking into complaints about its driver assistance systems. Tesla is grappling with slumping EV sales. Deliveries of its cars are poised to fall for the second consecutive year. Elon Musk, its chief executive, has shifted the company's focus toward robotaxis and humanoid robots, but Tesla still relies heavily on its core car business. Consumer backlash against Musk's ties to the Trump administration has dented sales in recent months. But the EV maker has also failed to entice consumers through new, more affordable vehicles, despite its release of a new Model Y version this year. More competition has chipped away at Tesla's market share, contributing to its recent woes. Its US market share fell to an almost eight-year low in August, Reuters reported, citing data from research firm Cox Automotive.","U.S. safety regulators have launched an investigation into Tesla's 2021 Model Y after receiving nine complaints about malfunctioning door handles that trapped children inside.

In several instances, parents were forced to break windows to rescue their children.  While the doors have interior handles, children may not be able to reach them.  This investigation, which could lead to a recall, is the latest NHTSA probe into Tesla, which is also facing scrutiny over its driver-assistance systems and struggles with declining sales amid increased competition and consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk.

They are also finding people using badges belonging to family members without them present, and even badges of those who have died - which is illegal. Paul Slowey, from the Blue Badge Fraud Investigation (BBFI) agency, says he is confiscating ""more fake badges than ever before"", and that the Blue Badge scheme is being ""thoroughly abused"" by those wanting to get free parking that they are not entitled to. The government says it has strengthened powers by enabling plain clothes officers to inspect Blue Badges and confiscate those being used misused. The Blue Badge scheme gives disabled people access to specially adapted designated bays. Badge holders are allowed to park for free in on-street pay-and-display bays and for up to three hours on yellow lines - except where there are loading restrictions. They are also exempt from paying the London Congestion Charge which costs £15 / day. Parking can come at a premium, with on-street bays costing as much as £5.90 per hour in some parts of the south-east England. This makes the badges desirable to thieves and fraudsters, who sell them on. Paul Slowey helps local councils to investigate fraudulent use of Blue Badges The BBFI agency, a community interest company run by Mr Slowey from Hampshire, helps local councils check drivers are using Blue Badges correctly. Fake and stolen badges are being sold online for hundreds of pounds He says he is confiscating ""more fake badges than ever before"", and that the Blue Badge system is being ""thoroughly abused"". Mr Slowey is calling for more enforcement to help check and seize badges, which he hopes will lead to prosecutions. Steve Swyer Steve Swyer describes his car, and a place to park it, as a lifeline The use of fake badges, taking up the already limited number of disabled bays, has a knock-on effect. Steve Swyer, who lives in rural Surrey. has a Blue Badge because he has multiple sclerosis (MS). He uses a wheelchair so he needs to park somewhere level and with a dropped curb and which is close to his destination. He says disabled bays cater to these needs, but often cars are parked in the bays with no Blue Badge displayed. ""It used to make me quite angry but I've got so used to it now. It's just become a part of normal life for me - to pull up and realise you can't get where you need to go,"" Mr Swyer said. ""If I didn't have the car I'd spend probably 90% of my time indoors, literally not seeing anybody or going anywhere."" He says he is always fearful someone might break into his car to steal his Blue Badge. ""You're advertising something that's very valuable - it makes you a target."" Mark Jobling says family members and carers must not use a Blue Badge without having the disabled person in the car with them East Sussex County Council is one of the local authorities now checking for Blue Badge abuse. Mark Jobling, an investigations officer in the council's Blue Badge team, says one-in-five badges is being misused. He says he mostly deals with disabled people's family members using the badge without the badge holder present, but also has had cases of people using a deceased relative's badge. Erika North has a hidden disability. She says she is often challenged about parking in disabled bays, despite showing her Blue Badge Erika North from Kent works for BBC Children in Need. She also has multiple sclerosis. Disabled bays near where she lives ""are so in demand, often by 10am the few areas that have disabled bays are already full up,"" she says. ""My Blue Badge enables me to carry on as I normally should be able to do for as long as possible. ""It's not some sort of perk"". Parking in a disabled bay without displaying a valid Blue Badge can result in a fine. Blue Badge misuse - such as using someone else's permit - comes with harsher penalties. It is a classed as fraud and is punishable by an unlimited fine or up to two years in prison. A new scheme to crackdown on Blue Badge misuse was launched in Brighton and Hove in December. 'Competing priorities' The charity Disabled Motoring UK is calling for local authorities to be given more resources for enforcement. The Local Government Association says councils will do what they can, but they have to take into account a number of competing priorities when using their limited resources to take enforcement action against blue badge fraud. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""Exploitation of the Blue Badge scheme is completely unacceptable – it is a vital resource helping many people travel with confidence. It says it is ""supporting the police to tackle this issue by working closely with local authorities"". It says it has strengthened the powers to help local authorities tackle fraud and misuse, and given them the ability to cancel stolen badges.","Fraudulent use of Blue Badges, permits allowing disabled drivers to park freely, is surging, prompting concerns and a crackdown.  Investigators report a record number of fake, stolen, and misused badges, including those belonging to deceased individuals.  The ease of obtaining counterfeit badges online, coupled with the high cost of parking in some areas, fuels this crime.  While the government has strengthened enforcement powers, allowing plain-clothes officers to confiscate misused badges,  advocates like the Blue Badge Fraud Investigation agency call for even stronger measures and increased prosecutions.  Disabled drivers themselves express frustration at the scarcity of accessible parking spaces, further exacerbated by fraudulent badge use, and fear for their personal safety due to the perceived value of their badges.  Penalties for misuse range from fines to prison sentences, but the problem persists, highlighting the need for increased resources and stricter enforcement by local authorities.

These polar ""geoengineering"" techniques aim to cool the planet in unconventional ways, such as artificially thickening sea-ice or releasing tiny, reflective particles into the atmosphere. They have gained attention as potential future tools to combat global warming, alongside cutting carbon emissions. But more than 40 researchers say they could bring ""severe environmental damage"" and urged countries to simply focus on reaching net zero, the only established way to limit global warming. Geoengineering - deliberately intervening in the Earth's climate system to counter the impacts of global warming - is one of the most controversial areas of climate research. Some types are widely accepted - removing planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere via planting trees or using machines, for example, are recognised parts of net zero efforts. Net zero means balancing the amount of planet-warming ""greenhouse"" gases produced by human activities with the amount being actively removed from the atmosphere. But some more radical geoengineering ideas, like reflecting sunlight ""are dealing with the symptoms of climate change rather than the causes,"" said lead author Martin Siegert, professor of geosciences at the University of Exeter. For supporters, it is worth exploring techniques which could help rein in rapidly rising temperatures, which are already bringing severe impacts for people and ecosystems around the world. But for opponents, the risks are simply too great – particularly for the fragile polar regions, about which much remains unknown. The scientists behind the new assessment, published in the journal Frontiers in Science, reviewed the evidence for five of the most widely discussed polar geoengineering ideas. All fail to meet basic criteria for their feasibility and potential environmental risks, they say. One such suggestion is releasing tiny, reflective particles called aerosols high into the atmosphere to cool the planet. This often attracts attention among online conspiracy theorists, who falsely claim that condensation trails in the sky – water vapour created from aircraft jet engines – is evidence of sinister large-scale geoengineering today. But many scientists have more legitimate concerns, including disruption to weather patterns around the world. With those potential knock-on effects, that also raises the question of who decides to use it – especially in the Arctic and Antarctic, where governance is not straightforward. If a country were to deploy geoengineering against the wishes of others, it could ""increase geopolitical tensions in polar regions"", according to Dr Valerie Masson-Delmotte, senior scientist at the Université Paris Saclay in France. Another fear is that while some of the ideas may be theoretically possible, the enormous costs and time to scale-up mean they are extremely unlikely to make a difference, according to the review. One idea BBC News recently looked at was a plan to pump seawater over the surface of Arctic sea-ice in winter to thicken it, giving the ice a better chance to survive the summer. But to cover 10% of the Arctic could require about 10 million seawater pumps, one estimate suggests. A more fundamental concern is that these types of projects could create the illusion of an alternative to cutting humanity's emissions of planet-warming gases. ""If they are promoted… then they are a distraction because to some people they will be a solution to the climate crisis that doesn't require decarbonising,"" said Prof Siegert. ""Of course that would not be true and that's why we think they can be potentially damaging."" BBC/Jemma Cox One suggestion to save Thwaites Glacier, one of the most vulnerable Antarctic glaciers, is to install a giant sea ""curtain"" to stop warm water melting it more quickly - but the new study says this would be extremely costly and unlikely to work Even supporters of geoengineering research agree that it is, at best, a supplement to net zero, not a substitution. ""The need for emissions reductions comes first… almost anything we do is futile without it,"" according to Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, director of the University of Cambridge's Centre for Climate Repair, which has been involved in some of the projects highlighted. The assessment raises ""very valid concerns"" about some of the ideas, but they need to be balanced against the risks from ""the perilous state of the climate,"" he argued. Like many other supporters of geoengineering research, Dr Fitzgerald does not support deploying it on a large scale yet, and acknowledged that further investigation might indeed find that the ideas are ""bonkers"". But he argued that more research would allow society to make ""more informed decisions"" about whether they could help or hinder in the fight against climate change. A UK government-backed agency recently announced nearly £60m of funding for such research, though the government says it has no plans to deploy them. But the authors of the new assessment view these projects as so unrealistic that efforts would be better directed towards decarbonisation and polar research. ""There are some basic home truths that don't need an awful lot of research to come to a conclusion that they're not really viable,"" argued Prof Siegert. A UK government spokesperson said: ""Our priority is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from human activities and to adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change.""","Scientists warn against Arctic geoengineering, urging focus on emissions reduction.  A new study published in *Frontiers in Science* concludes that proposed geoengineering techniques to combat climate change in the Arctic and Antarctic are dangerous, impractical, and could cause severe environmental damage.  The researchers reviewed five widely discussed methods, including atmospheric aerosol release and artificial sea-ice thickening, finding them all infeasible and risky.  They argue that these approaches distract from the crucial need for global decarbonization,  potentially creating a false sense of security and hindering genuine emissions reduction efforts. While some researchers advocate further investigation into geoengineering, the study's authors contend that resources would be better spent on achieving net-zero emissions and furthering polar research. The UK government, while funding related research, maintains its focus remains on emissions reduction and climate adaptation.

It seeks to protect and restore all semi-natural peatlands in Northern Ireland to functioning ecosystems by 2040, through a series of 26 actions to meet five objectives. It includes a consultation on restricting sales of peat and peat products, a wildfire strategy, and the creation of a register of peatlands to help identify those sites most immediately in need of support. But it highlights that ""significant financial resources"" will be needed to meet the aims. Speaking during the launch of the strategy on Divis Mountain, the Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs Minister Andrew Muir said peatland restoration was a ""win-win"" for Northern Ireland. ""This could make a significant difference to our nature, to water quality, but also our goals in terms of decarbonisation. ""This is a game-changer,"" he said. Minister Andrew Muir said the peatland strategy was a ""game-changer"" for the environment in Northern Ireland Peatlands help to filter water, removing pollution and nutrients before they reach wastewater treatment plants or water bodies, like Lough Neagh. Peter Harper from the Lough Neagh Partnership attended the announcement in the Belfast Hills. ""Whatever is happening in these hills in terms of peatland restoration is going to impact on Lough Neagh, so there's an absolute connection between what's happening on this land and what's happening in the lough itself. ""So if we can reduce the amount of nutrients and phosphates coming into the lough, that's a good thing."" Peter Harper is responsible for the implementation of the Lough Neagh Shoreline Management Plan in his role with the Lough Neagh Partnership A steering group will be formed to oversee implementation of the strategy along with a delivery plan and reporting framework within four months. Semi-natural peatland cover - lowland raised bogs, blanket bogs and fens - in Northern Ireland is high at 12%, making our peatlands internationally important. They account for just over half (53%) of all the carbon stored in soil across Northern Ireland - known as the soil carbon pool. But the majority of them (86%) are degraded. That causes the peat to emit the carbon it has previously absorbed, rather than store it as it does when wet and healthy. ""Highly modified peat soils"" - peat with trees planted on it and grasslands - cover another 6% of Northern Ireland. Restoring peatlands and peaty soils is seen as key in meeting climate change targets and tackling emissions. Peatland can hold up to 20 times its weight in water and can help control floods as well as storing carbon, according to the National Trust","Northern Ireland unveils a comprehensive strategy to protect and restore its peatlands by 2040.

On Monday, it was announced that the concerts will take place in Blackweir Fields again in 2026 with Lewis Capaldi set to headline one of the gigs. Artists such as Stevie Wonder, Alanis Morissette, Noah Kahan and Slayer performed at the Cardiff park in June and July this year. The announcement was met with mixed reaction with local groups raising concerns around traffic and noise pollution. Friends of Bute Park have been critical of the council's handling of the events. In response to a council survey on the events, the group mentioned the removal of trees to create entrances for the event site; the impact on traffic, with gigs seeing dozens of drivers stuck in gridlocks for more than an hour; noise pollution, which resulted in 100 complaints to the council; and the impact on sports pitches. Syed Abbas, the chairman of Bay Dragons Cricket Club, said that the ""pitch degradation that was feared did happen"". He added that the club had no problem with the event although said if they are to coexist they would like some support from the council and organisers. In July, the council said in a statement the protective measures put in place during the events worked well and the grass, including cricket pitches, were ""generally in very good condition"". Chairman of the Cardiff Midweek Cricket League (CMCL), Khawaja Ali Ajmal, said he was not made aware of the decision by the council concerts in 2026. The council maintained throughout that it had been in discussion with sports teams about the use of Blackweir Fields for live music events. Syed Abbas Bay Dragons Cricket Club have been playing their matches at Blackweir Fields for more than ten years Earlier this year, a council report stated there was no application for planning permission in the run up to the shows, and that a certificate of lawfulness, which shows whether planning permission is required or not, had not been issued. The council said it had decided not to take formal planning enforcement action against the organisers. The site was brought down by 18 July but the council has said it will seek planning permission for the 2026 series. The council's main argument in favour is the money it brings in for the city's economy and the income that the local authority can put back into grassroots music and parks.

Cllr Huw Thomas, leader of the council said in an interview that income from Blackweir Live will help the council avoid difficult budget decisions in the future. The Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) asked the council how much money it made from Blackweir Live but the local authority refused to say.","Cardiff's Blackweir Fields will host another series of concerts in 2026, featuring Lewis Capaldi, following a successful but controversial run of shows this year.

This is one of the biggest environmental lawsuits in Zambia's history, with the farmers saying the spillage affects about 300,000 households in the copper-mining region. Million of litres of highly acidic material spilled into waterways in February, leading to ""mass fatalities"" among fish, making water undrinkable and destroying crops, the farmers said in court papers. Farmers in Zambia have filed an $80bn (£58.5bn) lawsuit against two Chinese-linked firms, blaming them for an ""ecological catastrophe"" caused by the collapse of a dam that stored waste from copper mining. The lawsuit pits villagers, who are mostly subsistence farmers, against Sino Metals Leach Zambia and NFC Africa Mining, which are subsidiaries of Chinese state-owned firms. A group of 176 of them have filed papers on behalf of their community in the High Court in Zambia's capital, Lusaka. They alleged the collapse of the tailings dam - owned by Sino Metals Leach Zambia but located in the surface area of NFC Africa Mining - was caused by numerous factors, including engineering failures, construction flaws and operational mismanagement. The firms have not yet commented on the lawsuit, but Sino Metals Leach Zambia has previously said there was a spillage of about 50,000 cubic metres. ""The tailings release and breach was promptly brought under control within hours of detection,"" the firm said in a statement on 3 September. In the court papers the farmers said they had learned that the water was highly toxic only several days after the tailings dam had collapsed, flooding farms and villages. It had put the community's health at risk, with people reporting various symptoms of illnesses, including blood in urine and chest tightness, the papers said. Most villages had dug wells, but even they were polluted and crops had to be burned because they were unsafe for consumption, the petitioners said. They demanded that the two firms should put $80bn in a Zambian government-managed account as ""security"" for, among others, ""environmental reparation"" and ""full compensation"". An emergency fund of $20m should also be set up to provide ""immediate and urgent"" help to people affected by the disaster, and to carry out thorough health and environmental assessments, the petitioners said. Last month, the US embassy said it had ordered the immediate withdrawal of its personnel from Kitwe - the biggest city in the Copperbelt region - and nearby areas after expressing concern that beyond the ""contaminated water and soil, contaminants from the spilled mine tailings may also become airborne, posing a health threat if inhaled"".

The spillage, affecting an estimated 300,000 households, has reportedly caused mass fish deaths, contaminated drinking water, destroyed crops, and led to various health problems including blood in urine and chest tightness among villagers.  While Sino Metals Leach Zambia claims the spillage was contained within hours and amounted to 50,000 cubic meters, farmers allege they were not informed of the toxicity of the water for days.  The US embassy issued a health alert in August, expressing concerns about widespread contamination and potential airborne threats, prompting a Zambian government denial of serious ongoing health risks.  The farmers are demanding $80 billion in environmental reparation and compensation, plus a $20 million emergency fund for immediate aid.  The mining companies have yet to comment on the lawsuit.

The technology has learned to spot patterns in people's medical records to calculate their risk of more than 1,000 diseases. The researchers say it is like a weather forecast that anticipates a 70% chance of rain – but for human health. Their vision is to use the AI model to spot high-risk patients to prevent disease and to help hospitals understand demand in their area, years ahead of time. The model – called Delphi-2M - uses similar technology to well-known AI chatbots like ChatGPT. AI chatbots are trained to understand patterns of language so they can predict the sequence of words in a sentence. Delphi-2M has been trained to find patterns in anonymous medical records so it can predict what comes next and when. It doesn't predict exact dates, like a heart attack on October 1, but instead estimates the likelihood of 1,231 diseases. ""So, just like weather, where we could have a 70% chance of rain, we can do that for healthcare,"" Prof Ewan Birney, the interim executive director of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, told me. ""And we can do that not just for one disease, but all diseases at the same time - we've never been able to do that before. I'm excited,"" he said. Jeff Dowling/EMBL-EBI Lead researcher Prof Ewan Birney says the model's disease predictions stack up The AI model was initially developed using anonymous UK data - including hospital admissions, GP records and lifestyle habits such as smoking - collected from more than 400,000 people as part of the UK Biobank research project. The model was then tested to see if its predictions stacked up using data from other Biobank participants, and then with 1.9 million people's medical records in Denmark. ""It's good, it's really good in Denmark,"" says Prof Birney. ""If our model says it's a one-in-10 risk for the next year, it really does seem like it turns out to be one in 10."" The model is best at predicting diseases like type 2 diabetes, heart attacks and sepsis that have a clear disease progression, rather than more random events like infections. What can you do with the results? People are already offered a cholesterol-lowering statin based on a calculation of their risk of a heart attack or stroke. The AI tool is not ready for clinical use, but the plan is to use it in a similar way, to spot high-risk patients while there is an opportunity to intervene early and prevent disease. This could include medicines or specific lifestyle advice - such as people likely to develop some liver disorders benefitting from cutting back their alcohol intake more than the general population. The artificial intelligence could also help inform disease-screening programmes and analyse all the healthcare records in an area to anticipate demand - such as how many heart attacks a year there will be in Norwich in 2030, to help plan resources. ""This is the beginning of a new way to understand human health and disease progression,"" said Prof Moritz Gerstung, head of the division of AI in oncology at DKFZ, the German Cancer Research Centre. He added: ""Generative models such as ours could one day help personalise care and anticipate healthcare needs at scale.""","Researchers at the University of California, San Diego, have developed Delphi-2M, an AI model capable of predicting the likelihood of over 1,200 diseases using anonymous medical records.  Similar to weather forecasting, the model provides probabilistic risk assessments (e.g., a 70% chance of developing a specific condition).  Initially trained on UK Biobank data (over 400,000 individuals) and validated with Danish data (1.9 million records), Delphi-2M demonstrates accuracy, particularly for diseases with predictable progression like type 2 diabetes and heart attacks.  While not yet ready for clinical use, the model's future applications include identifying high-risk patients for early intervention, informing disease-screening programs, and predicting healthcare demands years in advance.  This technology, leveraging similar techniques to AI chatbots, represents a significant advancement in personalized healthcare and resource allocation.

The Ghanaian-born British editor and stylist ended his tenure at British Vogue in 2023, and last week launched what he calls an ""inclusive"" new media platform, EE72. Speaking to BBC Radio 4 podcast Radical with Amol Rajan for London Fashion Week, Enninful suggested the industry risked going back to how it was before years of more inclusive modelling. ""I think we're potentially going back to an industry that's just sort of, 'one type is the norm, being European is the norm, being super-thin is the norm',"" he said. A string of high street fashion adverts that have been banned because they featured models who looked ""unhealthily thin"" has led industry experts to warn of a return to the super skinny trend, BBC News recently reported. Enninful described fashion as an ""industry in flux at the moment"". He said he's therefore ""excited"" to be returning at what feels like ""the perfect time"" because ""there's a lot of work to be done"". The first quarterly print edition of his new venture - titled 72 after the year he was born - focuses on the beauty of women over 50. It features Hollywood movie star and ""real human being"" Julia Roberts, 57, on its cover. Enninful came to London as an aslyum seeker, and after being appointed fashion director of the British fashion magazine i-D at the age of 18, he went on to become the first black editor-in-chief of British Vogue, where he championed diversity in order to ""represent the world we live in today."" Fashion 'has to figure out what we stand for' Asked by Rajan if he thought a cultural ""anti-woke moment"" was now taking place, he agreed. ""I think it's definitely a cultural moment,"" he replied. ""Woke is a dirty word. ""We see what's happening in the world politically. So anything that's not deemed as normal or the norm is seen as wrong."" The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines ""woke"" as meaning ""well-informed"" or ""up-to-date"" as well as being ""alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice"". It has been seen as a badge of honour by some on the left, but more often as an insult by those on the right. The fashionista continued: ""It's not woke to think that someone curvy is beautiful, it's not woke to think someone from another country is beautiful."" He believes the fashion industry ""has to figure out where we stand and what we stand for"".

He noted a cultural shift, describing the current climate as an ""anti-woke moment,"" where celebrating diversity is increasingly viewed negatively.  This shift, he fears, risks marginalizing models of different body types and ethnicities.  Enninful’s new platform, featuring Julia Roberts on its first cover, focuses on celebrating the beauty of women over 50, directly addressing the limited representation of older women in fashion.  He emphasizes the need for the industry to redefine its values and commit to genuine inclusivity.

Jewels! Dresses! Tiaras! State visits are as much about what everyone is wearing as they are about what they’re saying and doing. It is an exercise in fashion diplomacy - and there has been plenty of it on display as US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania visit the UK. From the First Lady's hat and striking yellow banquet dress, to the Princess of Wales's golden gown and historic tiara, here are some of the most eye-catching looks. Watch: Pomp, pageantry and protests as Trump gets the royal treatment in Windsor A striking yellow dress At Wednesday night's formal state banquet, Melania went bold. Yellow. And a baby pink belt. The strapless floor length, long-sleeved dress by Carolina Herrera is nothing short of a statement. Gone was the hat, so for the first time on Wednesday, we saw her full face. She wore her hair down, and completed the look with sparkling, dangly earrings. Phil Noble/Reuters For the state banquet, Donald Trump wore white tie, while Melania Trump opted for a yellow dress with a pink belt For Marian Kwei, a celebrity stylist and Vogue contributor, Melania's gown was ""not the expected colour to see at a high state banquet"". ""Although it perhaps is in keeping with state dress protocol, the strapless gown is a little on the daring side,"" she said. It is not the first time we have seen Melania wear a strapless crepe gown for evening dress, however. She donned a similar design for her first dance following President Trump's inauguration in January. Reuters Camilla, the King, and Donald and Melania Trump showed off their banquet attire The Queen, 78, attended the evening banquet wearing a royal blue, silk, marocain embroidered dress by Fiona Clare, a sapphire and diamond tiara, and the King's Family Order. King Charles's regalia was in keeping with the high pomp and pageantry that we would expect of a state banquet. He wore a formal tuxedo, looking ""every inch the monarch"", noted Kwei. The King, 76, completed his look with a royal blue sash - a colour that matched Camilla's dress. Meanwhile President Trump, 79, dressed the part for the evening's event in white tie. Timeless suit - and a statement hat Andrew Matthews/Reuters The first lady's wide-brimmed purple hat covered much of her face Melania, 55, is no stranger to impressive headwear - her white and navy wide-brimmed hat was a talking point at her husband's inauguration earlier this year. There was even an awkward moment when Trump tried to kiss her and the brim of her hat made it a tricky task. Cue the internet blowing up. The first lady went for a similarly dramatic flourish during the first official events on Wednesday. She arrived at Windsor Castle wearing a wide-brimmed purple hat that seemed to obscure her eyes, which she paired with a timeless, dark grey suit by Dior. PA Media The Princess of Wales and Queen Camilla chatted to First Lady Melania Trump as she arrived at Windsor Castle ""Melania's hat is not by chance,"" said Kwei. ""The hat with the wide brim that hides her face is pointing to a stance where she wants all eyes on her husband and his agenda while here,"" she added. Reuters Melania's hat stayed on inside, unlike the Queen who removed hers Kwei noted that Melania’s hat matched the exact colour of Trump's tie, in ""a nod to her support for her husband's agenda during this state visit"". Dior is a favourite fashion house for Melania, and, for Kwei, her decision to wear it is a nod to America's support for Europe. Catherine's golden gown Phil Noble/Reuters The Princess of Wales wore a couture gown by British designer Phillipa Lepley with a Lover's Knot tiara For the state banquet on Wednesday evening, the Princess of Wales wore a couture gown by British designer Phillipa Lepley with a full-length gold Chantilly lace evening coat. The coat featured hand-embroidered roses with couched gold cording, accented with French knots and satin-stitched blooms. The 43-year-old, who is sporting a new, blonder hairstyle, completed her look with the Lover's Knot Tiara. ""Formal state banquets are one of the rare occasions when royals wear tiaras,"" said Kwei. ""Kate is wearing her favourite tiara, which is no surprise. It was a favourite of Princess Diana, and originally belonged to Queen Mary."" ""This is a really show-stopping dress and for me it really fits with the theme of this state visit being extra,"" royal expert Victoria Murphy added. She noted that gold isn't a colour we see Catherine wear a lot. ""But when she has worn it in the past, for example for [film] premieres, it has always been a real red-carpet moment,"" she said. The dress code for the state banquet was white tie, and the Prince of Wales, 43, did not disappoint. He was decked out in formal regalia and his orders, and wore an elegant Windsor tail coat. ""This is William at his most formal,"" said Murphy. She noted that on day-to-day engagements, the younger royals, in particular, can often be quite informal - but for an occasion like this, they pull out all the stops. ""The formality is all part of honouring the visiting guest,"" she said. A British classic On Tuesday night, Melania stepped onto UK soil wearing the most British of fashion items: a Burberry trench coat. She wore the honey-coloured, floor-length coat with the collar turned up, while flashes of its signature lining were visible underneath. Melania completed the look with black sunglasses and boots. Reuters Trump and Melania held hands when they landed at London Stansted Airport Vanessa Friedman, chief fashion critic at The New York Times, said that wearing a British-made coat could be an example of engaging in sartorial diplomacy, which is something many first ladies have done. For the Trumps' last state visit in 2019, Melania - a former model - also dressed in her British best, opting for brands such as Burberry, although she added a mix of European fashion houses too (think Celine and Dolce & Gabbana), as well as American designers including Michael Kors. It will be interesting to see how the choice of a British brand on this trip will be perceived back at home, says Kwei, given that Trump's message is about serving the interests of the United States before those of any other country. Melania Trump, enigmatic first lady who might do it differently this time Matching in blue Getty Images The King and Queen at the formal ceremonial welcome The Queen was seen during the day in a vibrant, sapphire blue dress, a matching coat by Fiona Clare and hat by Philip Treacy. She completed the look with a sapphire and diamond brooch. The Queen was matching with her husband, King Charles, who wore a blue suit and pale blue tie at the daytime events. A diplomatic message Getty Images The Princess of Wales smiled as she greeted the US guests The Princess of Wales wore a burgundy Emilia Wickstead dress and a matching hat by Jane Taylor to greet the US president and first lady on Wednesday. From both the Queen and the Princess, it's a strong showing for British designers. Catherine completed her look with a feather brooch. Kwei noted it was interesting that, like the Trumps, the princess also chose to match her outfit to her husband William, who wore a burgundy tie. ""As with Melania, this is to show support and that she's at one with her spouse and home country's agenda,"" she said. ""Blue and red!,"" royal expert Murphy said of the outfit choices by the Queen and Catherine. ""This seems a clear example of coordinated diplomatic dressing to me, to reflect the US flag. ""It's an example of how the outfits can send a powerful diplomatic message.""","During the Trump's UK state visit, fashion took center stage.  Melania Trump's striking yellow Carolina Herrera gown at the state banquet, a departure from expected attire, sparked discussion, as did her earlier wide-brimmed purple hat, interpreted by some as a deliberate attempt to keep the focus on her husband.  Princess Catherine's gold Phillipa Lepley gown and Lover's Knot tiara were equally noteworthy, showcasing a regal yet modern look.  Queen Camilla and Queen Elizabeth II also made fashion statements with their respective outfits, with the latter's sapphire blue ensemble noted for its coordinated elegance alongside King Charles.  Experts highlighted the potential for sartorial diplomacy, noting the colour coordination between the royals' outfits and the US flag, as well as Melania's choice of British brands like Burberry.  The event underscored the significant role fashion plays in international diplomacy and state visits.

The 45-year-old from Preston had used the same brand - Frontline Plus - for years without any trouble. But within hours of applying a new dose he'd bought online, his usually lively tabby was violently ill, vomiting and refusing food or water. ""I bought it from a major online site and the price seemed similar so I didn't suspect anything at the time,"" Alan told the BBC's Morning Live.

Emergency surgery saved his life - at a cost of £3,000 - and tests later confirmed he had suffered a toxic reaction. Alan returned to the vet with the packaging. At first glance, it looked genuine, labelled as ""Gatti"" - which Alan assumed might be an Italian version of the medication. But when the manufacturer was contacted, they confirmed it was counterfeit and laboratory testing found it contained a chemical highly toxic to cats. ""We felt really guilty about the fact we had done this to him,"" Alan said. ""But finding out it was fake medication, we were really angry.

In a statement on X, Miki Zohar said: ""There is no greater slap in the face of Israeli citizens than the embarrassing and detached annual Ophir Awards ceremony."" The film, which follows a boy from the occupied West Bank who wants to travel to Tel Aviv to see the sea for the first time, won best film at the Ophir Awards - Israel's equivalent of the Oscars. Israel's culture minister has threatened to axe funding for the country's national film awards after The Sea, a story about a 12-year-old Palestinian boy, won its top award. It is not yet clear whether Zohar has the authority to defund the awards, according to local media. Stars of The Sea won other major prizes at the awards ceremony, including best actor award for 13-year-old Muhammad Gazawi - the youngest ever winner. In the film, Gazawi plays 12-year-old Khaled who is denied entry to Israel at an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) checkpoint during a class trip to Tel Aviv. Khaled then sneaks into Israel and attempts to reach the sea while his father, an undocumented labourer in Israel, tries to find him. During the ceremony, the film's producer Baher Agbariya said the film was about ""every child's right to live in peace, a basic right we will not give up on"". But in his statement, Zohar described the Ophir Awards as ""embarrassing and detached"". He added: ""Under my watch, Israeli citizens will not pay from their pockets for a ceremony that spits in the faces of our heroic soldiers."" Responding to Zohar's comments, Assaf Amir, chair of the Israeli Academy of Film and Television, said: ""As the never-ending war in Gaza takes a terrible toll in death and destruction, the ability to see the 'other'... gives small hope."" Amir added: ""In the face of the Israeli government's attacks on Israeli cinema and culture, and the calls from parts of the international film community to boycott us, the selection of The Sea is a powerful and resounding response."" It comes after thousands of Hollywood industry professionals signed a pledge vowing not to work with Israeli film institutions that are ""implicated in genocide"". Israel launched its war in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 65,000 people have been killed in Israeli attacks since then, almost half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. On Tuesday, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel's foreign ministry rejected the report and denounced it as ""distorted and false"".","Israel's Culture Minister Miki Zohar threatened to defund the Ophir Awards, the country's equivalent of the Oscars, after the Palestinian film ""The Sea"" won Best Picture.  The film, depicting a young Palestinian boy's journey to see the sea, also garnered several other major awards, including Best Actor for its 13-year-old star.  Zohar condemned the awards ceremony on X, calling it ""embarrassing and detached"" from Israeli society and claiming it insults Israeli soldiers.  While the minister's authority to defund the awards is unclear, his statement follows a UN commission of inquiry accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza, a claim Israel vehemently denies.  Conversely, supporters of ""The Sea"" see its win as a powerful statement against the backdrop of the ongoing conflict.

He and his business partners printed pictures on an industrial scale, as well as putting his immediately recognisable imagery on furniture and ornaments, and selling them on the QVC shopping network. They also set up hundreds of faux olde worlde Thomas Kinkade Signature Galleries in shopping malls around the US, and trademarked the ""Painter of Light"" brand. Again, Yousef doesn't see Kinkade as entirely calculating. Having grown up in a house with no pictures on the walls, ""He sincerely believed that art should be accessible to everyone."" Behind the fantasy Whatever you thought of the paintings, the mass-marketing of the work of a single artist was certainly groundbreaking. In interviews at the time, Kinkade asserted that he was no different from an author selling stacks of novels or a musician selling CDs. He even declared that by industrialising his output, he was doing what Andy Warhol had always dreamt of. But Mullins argues that Kinkade was being ""obfuscatory and disingenuous"" by churning out reproductions by the thousand, paying his assistants to add a few dabs of paint here and there, and then selling these prints for thousands of dollars, as if they were rare and precious works of art. ""Prints offer an affordable way of buying art by great artists,"" she says. ""They retain their value through the limited nature of the edition. This was never Kinkade's strategy."" The Kinkade Family Foundation Kinkade printed pictures and merchandise on an industrial scale and trademarked the ""Painter of Light"" brand (Credit: The Kinkade Family Foundation) Still, this sort of disagreement between Kinkade and his critics was one of his selling points. Art for Everybody features news reports and promotional videos, in which he tells adoring audiences that his art could be understood and appreciated by everyone, whereas only the snooty elite could see anything artistic about Chris Ofili putting elephant dung on his canvases, or Tracey Emin presenting her unmade bed to gallery-goers. ""This is not legitimate art,"" he proclaimed. As much a televangelist as a painter, Kinkade was a born-again Christian who assured his devotees that buying his work put them on the right side of a political and spiritual line separating them from decadent metropolitan tastemakers. He trademarked the sobriquet ""Painter of Light"", not just because of all the sunlit clouds and fiery cottages in his pictures, but to signify that he was a force for virtue and Christianity. ""The art world is a world of darkness today,"" he thundered. He, in contrast, was ""someone who stands up for family and God and country and beauty"". A doughy, plaid shirt-wearing fellow with a thick moustache, he often appeared on television with his blonde wife and his four blonde daughters: the embodiment of wholesome, traditional, all-American values. His fans weren't just paying for his pictures; they were paying to associate themselves with this proudly conservative persona. But that persona, like the pictures themselves, was more a fantasy that Kinkade wished for than an accurate representation of reality. He was prone to swearing after the directors of his mawkishvideos called ""cut"". He relied on alcohol to cope with work pressures. And, in the documentary, his daughters say that they were encouraged to smile in videos and personal appearances, but often felt as if their father cared more about his career than about them. ""Thomas Kinkade and his persona and his brand really cast an extraordinarily long, dark shadow over his entire family,"" says Yousef, ""and there was a lot wrapped up in perpetuating the brand and preserving it.""","Thomas Kinkade, the ""Painter of Light,"" built a multi-million dollar empire by mass-producing his idyllic landscapes and aggressively marketing them through QVC and hundreds of franchised galleries.  While his daughter credits his impoverished upbringing for inspiring his accessible art, critics argue his industrial-scale production, employing assistants to finish paintings, compromised artistic integrity. Kinkade himself compared his approach to that of prolific authors and musicians, claiming to achieve Warhol's dream of industrialized art.  However, this mass production and the carefully cultivated image of a devout, family-oriented Christian conservative,  hid a more complex reality.  Behind the wholesome persona, Kinkade struggled with alcohol and a strained relationship with his family, who felt overshadowed by the demands of his brand.  This contrast between his public image and private life, along with the controversy surrounding his artistic methods, ultimately became a key part of his success story.

Powell says the revisions are primarily due to how the data is collected and the low response rate from employers to surveys from the bureau that compiles the data. This means that often the most reliable data is several weeks behind, he says. ""We want higher response rates, and we need those to have less volatile data,"" he says, ""And the way to get that is to make sure that the agencies that collect the data have sufficient resources to drive higher response rates. It's not a complicated problem, but that's what it takes."" However, the monthly data they get is still ""good enough for us to do our work,"" Powell says. The Fed boss is also asked if the central bank would have cut rates earlier had the jobs numbers correctly reflected the less abundant jobs situation previously. ""You know, we have to live life looking through the windshield rather than the rear view mirror,"" he says. ""All I can tell you is we see where we are now and we take appropriate action and we took that appropriate action today.""","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell defended the accuracy of US jobs data, stating that while recent revisions from the Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed a weaker-than-previously-reported jobs market early this year, the data remains ""good enough"" for the Fed's decision-making.  Powell attributed the revisions to low employer response rates in BLS surveys, resulting in delays and volatility. He advocated for increased resources for data collection agencies to improve response rates and data accuracy.  However, he emphasized that the Fed's actions are based on current assessments, not solely on retrospective data revisions.  The Fed, he said, ""has to live life looking through the windshield rather than the rearview mirror.""

Lucie’s collision with Darnay and Carton unleashes a powerful and complex love triangle. Both men fight to be worthy of her love, and Lucie is torn over which one to choose. Yet neither man - physically so alike, spiritually poles apart - can escape the other. Instead, they find themselves bound together in life and death, through triumphs, tragedies, marriage, and murder.

He points to the exact spot, a few hundred metres away on the mountain opposite, where lightning struck a few weeks earlier, igniting a wildfire that had disastrous consequences. ""This August has been a nightmare for me personally, but also for the local farmers and everyone here in the village,"" he says. ""I'm 47 and I've never seen a fire that fierce."" It ended up burning more than 20,000 hectares (49,000 acres) of land and causing thousands of people to be evacuated from villages in this farming-heavy corner of north-western Spain, near the Portuguese border. But it was just one of several vast blazes which have devastated Spain this summer, burning 0.8% of the country's surface area. The most heavily affected zones were here in the north-west, including the regions of Castilla y León and Galicia, plus the western region of Extremadura. Honey production, which is an important industry in rural north-west Spain, was one of the main casualties of the summer. Mr Bruña knows people who have lost up to 400 beehives in the fires. Fortunately, his own 1,500 hives are intact, because the fire stopped just metres away from the fields where he keeps them. But the damage caused to nearby flora will have serious repercussions for his business. ""I calculate that this year I'm going to lose 50% of my honey production, at the very least, because of the fires, and the following year the same, or even worse,"" Mr Bruña says. This is because of the time it will take for the flowers that bees need to grow back again in surrounding fields. ""There are some types of flower that won't appear again for three years,"" he explains. The lack of structural damage to his hives means he cannot claim insurance. He is considering moving many of them elsewhere, in the hope of improving the bees' chances of survival and reducing his future losses. Guy Hedgecoe José Antonio Bruña says his bees will now produce less honey for a number of years Many livestock farmers have also been forced to move their animals in recent weeks, both to avoid fires and to ensure they can access unburned pasture. ""Things couldn't have been worse for farmers [this summer], it was one fire after another,"" says Fernando García, a cow farmer from Castromil, a village on the border between Castilla y León and Galicia. He spoke after spending hours working with local volunteers and firefighters to bring under control yet another blaze, on the edge of the village. Mr García has lost around 30 cattle this summer, most recently having to put down 11 animals which had suffered severe burns. At times, he has even kept his cows enclosed instead of letting them roam, because of fears about the fires. ""All of this has had a big economic impact, but the biggest impact of all is that we can't sleep at night,"" he says. ""It's a constant tension."" Although farmers like Mr García expect to receive insurance payments, he believes there will be a knock-on cost. ""They may pay us, but next year, instead of costing us, for example, €5,000 [$5,858; £4,328], insurance premiums will cost €10,000 or €15,000,"" he says. ""Because insurance companies don't want to lose money."" The COAG national farmers' association estimated in August, when several large fires were still burning, that the industry had suffered damages worth at least €600m. The biggest costs have been burned fields and properties and deaths of animals. However, there are other substantial damages, such as to beehives, and antennae used by farmers to locate their animals. Farmers' representatives are currently locked in negotiations with regional governments over how much public money should be paid out to help the sector recover. The other main economic victim of this summer's fires has been tourism, which represents 13% of Spanish GDP and has been a motor of the country's strong recent growth. Although most of the coastal areas which are associated with tourism avoided fires this summer, the southern province of Cádiz was an exception as hotels, holiday homes and camping sites were evacuated because of blazes. Guy Hedgecoe And this summer's main wildfire hotspots, in the west and north-west, have developed rural tourism in recent years as an alternative to the beach holidays for which Spain used to be known. Hiking is popular here, for example along the Camino de Santiago trail or in the area's mountain ranges, as is wine and food related tourism. Sanabria Lake, the largest glacial body of water in the Iberian peninsula, is a major local attraction, surrounded by a natural park. But the spread of the fire that began in Porto de Sanabria in mid-August caused it to be shut down. And many tourists left the area, as smoke filled the air in nearby towns. ""In August, this area was at full capacity in terms of tourism and people who have second homes here,"" says Miguel Ángel Martos, the mayor of Galende, which is a few minutes' drive from the lake. ""And then, on 18 August, it dropped down to 10% of capacity."" For tourists this was inconvenient. But for many locals it spelled financial disaster. Among them was Óscar David García López, who has a contract to hire two bar-restaurants on the shores of the lake. He estimates that during the second half of August, when the local authorities closed down the lake, he lost €80,000, because of the rental of the bars, the wages and social security payments of his 14 employees, and the food which he had bought but which could not be sold. ""The regional government has said it will pay me €5,500,"" he says, laughing bitterly at the thought. ""They are going to have to come up with some other kind of compensation because I didn't want to close, they forced me to."" The Hosteltur tourism association warned that the damage caused by the wildfires in such areas ""is not limited to the material impact, but also the impact on the image… of these destinations"". Guy Hedgecoe Óscar David García López's lakeside bars have lost money","Spain's northwest grapples with the devastating aftermath of a summer of wildfires, which scorched 0.8% of the country's land.  The blazes, including one that consumed over 20,000 hectares, forced thousands of evacuations and caused significant economic damage.  The agricultural sector suffered heavily, with honey production severely impacted; beekeeper José Antonio Bruña anticipates a 50% loss due to the destruction of floral resources.  Livestock farmers also faced losses, with Fernando García losing 30 cattle.  The COAG farmers' association estimates agricultural damage at €600m.  Tourism, representing 13% of Spain's GDP, was also hit hard.  The closure of Sanabria Lake, a major tourist attraction, due to a wildfire caused significant losses for local businesses like Óscar David García López's lakeside bars, which lost an estimated €80,000.  Farmers and tourism operators are negotiating with regional governments for financial aid, with discussions expected to continue until year's end.  The long-term economic impact of the wildfires is expected to be substantial, including increased insurance premiums for farmers.

""We are proud, but there is also a mixed baggage of trauma, regret and anger,"" says Tanuja Pandey, one of the protest organisers. With 72 people killed, last week's protests were the deadliest unrest in the Himalayan country in decades. Official buildings, residences of political leaders and luxury hotels such as the Hilton, which opened in July 2024, were torched, vandalised and looted. The wife of a former prime minister is fighting for her life after their home was set ablaze. The protests represented ""a wholesale rejection of Nepal's current political class for decades of poor governance and exploitation of state resources"", said Ashish Pradhan, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group. But the damage to government services, he added, could ""parallel the toll of the 2015 earthquake which took almost 9,000 lives"". The destruction is not only confined to the capital Kathmandu - at least 300 local government offices across the nation have been damaged. The financial losses could amount to 3 trillion Nepalese rupees ($21.3bn; £15.6bn), nearly half of the country's GDP, according to the Kathmandu Post. Its offices were also attacked by crowds and set on fire. Instagram / sgtthb Enraged by the huge inequality, young Nepalis have been calling the children of politicians ""nepo babies"" 'Nepo babies' Two days before the deadly demonstration on 8 September, Ms Pandey, a 24-year-old environmental campaigner, uploaded a video showing a mining site in Chure, one of the most fragile mountain ranges in the region. Nepal's resources should belong to the people, not to ""politicians' private limited companies"", she wrote, calling on her peers to ""march against corruption and the misuse of our nation's wealth"". Like many youth movements in Asia, Nepal's Gen Z protests were leaderless. Others had made similar pleas to Ms Pandey's after the Nepali government decided to ban 26 social media platforms, citing their failure to register locally. For months, fury had been brewing against ""nepo babies"", the children of powerful politicians of all stripes, who were accused of flaunting their unexplained wealth on social media. One of the most viral photos showed Saugat Thapa, the son of a provincial minister, standing next to a Christmas tree made of boxes of luxury brands including Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Cartier. In response, he said it was ""an unfair misinterpretation"" and his father ""returned every rupee earned from public service to the community"". Ms Pandey had watched almost all ""nepo babies"" content, but one video juxtaposing the luxurious life of a political family and an ordinary young Nepali who had to find work in a Gulf country struck her. ""It is painful to watch, especially knowing that even educated youth are forced to leave the country because wages here are far below what one needs to live with dignity,"" she said. Nepal is a young democracy. It became a republic in 2008, after a decade-long, Maoist-led civil war that killed more than 17,000 people. But the promised stability and prosperity have not materialised. In 17 years, Nepal has had 14 governments, and no leader has completed a full five-year term. The country's politics resemble a game of musical chairs, with communist parties and the centrist Nepali Congress taking turns to rule. Three leaders, including KP Sharma Oli who resigned over the Gen Z protests, returned to power multiple times. Nepal's GDP per capita remained under $1,500, making it the second-poorest country in South Asia, behind only Afghanistan. An estimated 14% of the population work overseas, and one in three households receives remittances. Ms Pandey comes from a middle-class family in eastern Nepal and her father is a retired government teacher. Three years ago, she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, for which she is still receiving treatment. The medical bills nearly bankrupted her family, so her older sister moved to Australia to support them. Before the protests, Ms Pandey worked with others to create guidelines stressing non-violence and respect and reminding participants to stay vigilant against ""hijackers"". On the morning of 8 September, she arrived at Maitighar Mandala, a huge traffic island in central Kathmandu with several of her friends. She was expecting thousands would turn up at most – but the crowds kept swelling. Aakriti Ghimire, a 26-year-old protester, said things were initially peaceful and communal. ""We were all seated, we were singing old Nepali songs,"" she said. ""The slogans and everything were so funny, we were enjoying it. And after that, we started to march… the police were there to ensure that there were no vehicles disturbing us."" Both Ms Pandey and Ms Ghimire started to sense danger at around midday, when crowds began moving to New Baneshwor, the neighbourhood housing parliament. Both saw people arriving on motorbikes, and Ms Pandey said these people appeared older than average Gen Z protesters. Ms Ghimire believes they were infiltrators. ""It became very tricky for us to distinguish the peaceful protesters – some people who genuinely came for something – versus those who came in with the intention of being violent."" When some protesters tried to breach the security around parliament, police fired tear gas, water cannon and shots in return. There is evidence live rounds were used and they are accused of shooting at schoolchildren as well. An investigation into what happened is under way. Reuters The Hilton was one of the targets of arsonist attacks Chaos and violence reigned the next day. Demonstrators retaliated by setting parliament, the prime minister's office and other government buildings ablaze. Both Ms Pandey and Ms Ghimire stayed indoors and watched the developments online. ""A lot of people did share that it felt so good to finally see politicians face the consequences of everything they've done,"" Ms Ghimire said, referring to the destruction of the leaders' homes. But the mood soon darkened. ""I saw people with bottles filled with petroleum. They got it from the motorbikes. They started attacking the parliament,"" said Ms Pandey. The law graduate cried after seeing the Supreme Court on fire, saying that it was like ""a temple"" for her. Her friends at the scene were pouring water on the flames to try to put them out. They all knew the effort would be futile – they did it only to console themselves. ""People say the arsonists intended to come and burn these things… Who are these people?"" asked Ms Ghimire. ""The videos show these people are all masked."" Some calm was restored when the army was deployed to take control of the situation - a curfew was in place for days. Later in the week former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki was appointed interim prime minister. She had been backed by protesters for the post. Ms Pandey hopes she ""can lead the country efficiently, do the election in stipulated time and hand the power to the people"". But the anxiety about Nepal's political future persists. Rumela Sen, a South Asia expert at Columbia University, said it was ""worrying"" to see ""an unprecedented glorification of the army as a voice of sanity and stability"". Many are also uncomfortable with the involvement of Durga Prasai in the initial negotiation at the invitation of the military. Mr Prasai was arrested for his role in violent pro-monarchy protests in March. He fled to India but was returned to Nepal. The Gen Z protesters walked out of the talks over his involvement. Reuters","Gen Z-led protests in Nepal toppled the government in 48 hours, leaving a trail of destruction and raising concerns about the country's future.  Fueled by anger over decades of corruption and the opulent lifestyles of politicians' children (""nepo babies""), the protests resulted in 72 deaths and an estimated $21.3 billion in damages – potentially exceeding the impact of the 2015 earthquake.  While initially peaceful, the demonstrations escalated into violence, with government buildings and the Hilton hotel set ablaze.  Although protesters celebrated the ousting of the government,  concerns remain about the violence, the involvement of potential infiltrators, and the army's increased role in restoring order.  Sushila Karki, Nepal's first female prime minister, was appointed to lead an interim government, but the long-term political stability of the young democracy remains uncertain.

The tiny teardrop-shaped isle lies about 35km off central Chile’s Pacific coast and its dark-green slopes are easily visible from the mainland. But Mocha is far from easy to reach. There are no passenger ferries or public boat services. The only way to get to the mountainous 48-sq-km island is via a six-seat, single-propeller plane from the mainland fishing village of Tirua. Stepping out onto the windswept airstrip, Mocha could hardly feel more remote. But Mocha’s relative isolation and tranquillity belies centuries of commerce, conflict and upheaval. Pirates have come and gone, boats have run aground, and the island has been shaped by the sea and its many shipwrecks.","Mocha Island, a remote 48-sq-km isle off the coast of central Chile, boasts a rich and dramatic history.  Accessible only by small plane, this teardrop-shaped island, visible from the mainland but difficult to reach, has served as a haven for buccaneers, a resting place for shipwrecks, and even home to a famous humpback whale.  According to local Mapuche legend, the island was also a destination for the spirits of the deceased.  Its relative isolation today belies centuries of maritime activity, conflict, and the shaping influence of the Pacific Ocean.

The cost of food and non-alcoholic drinks grew at an annual rate of 5.1% as beef, butter, milk and chocolate prices continued to surge. However, despite the increase in food costs, price growth in other areas such as air fares slowed, leaving the overall rate of UK inflation at 3.8% - the same as July. Economists said food bills have been rising because supermarkets were passing on government increases in the minimum wage and National Insurance Contributions (NIC) to shoppers through higher prices. It also said that inflation in the UK was ""significantly higher"" than the estimates for large European economies such as France and Germany. In August, France's inflation was 0.8% while Germany recorded price growth of 2.1%. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said Britain had become ""an outlier in recent months on inflation compared to other major economies"". She said: ""Since April, the rise in inflation has been driven largely by domestic policy choices, including the increase in employers' National Insurance Contributions. ""These higher costs have been passed on by businesses to consumers, feeding through into higher headline inflation."" Some food items have continued to see particularly big increases. In the year to August, beef and veal prices were up nearly 25%, while butter prices grew by nearly 19% and chocolate rose by 15.4%. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said that food costs were outstripping average wage growth, which the ONS said reached 4.7% between May and July. ""With food inflation now outpacing wages, many families will be struggling with the rising cost of living,"" Kris Hamer, director of insight at the BRC, said. However, the prices of some goods such as clothing and footwear eased, which the BRC said was ""driven in part by retailers discounting the last of their summer collections"". It added: ""Key staples such as cereals and pasta fell in price on the month."" James Smith, developed market economist at investment bank ING, said the inflation figure was ""certainly not good news for the Bank of England"". He told the BBC that it remaining at 3.8% ""means the prospect for further interest rate cuts this year very much hang in the balance"". ""In terms of where we go from here, food inflation could climb a little bit higher into the end of the year,"" he added. The Bank of England has cut interest rates five times since August last year, taking borrowing costs to 4%. It has said it expects inflation to peak at 4% in September. The central bank is widely expected to hold interest rates on Thursday. It then has two further rate-setting meetings this year - in November and December. Even with a projected rise in inflation, Capital Economics said it doubts the Bank will cut rates in November. But Paul Dales, its chief UK economist, said: ""We still expect the looser labour market to weaken wage growth and eventually bring down UK inflation to similar rates as in the US and the eurozone, which will allow the Bank of England to cut rates from 4% now to 3% by the end of next year."" 'NICs rise has stung' Coosh Bakery co-founder and director Tom Egan says its costs have risen","UK inflation remains at 3.8%, but food prices surge 5.1% annually, marking the fifth consecutive month of increase.  Beef, butter, milk, and chocolate prices saw particularly sharp rises.  Economists attribute the food price inflation to supermarkets passing on increased minimum wage and National Insurance contributions.  This places the UK significantly above inflation rates in other major European economies like France (0.8%) and Germany (2.1%).  While some goods like clothing saw price decreases, the rising cost of food, outpacing wage growth (4.7% May-July), is causing hardship for many families.  The Bank of England, currently holding interest rates at 3.8%, faces pressure to act, but a rate cut remains uncertain despite projections of inflation peaking at 4% in September.

Hammersmith and Fulham Council's cabinet has approved more than £3m in funding to ""enhance"" the local authority's camera network. The borough already has more cameras per person than anywhere else in the UK, with more than 2,000 currently operating. Campaign group Big Brother Watch said the use of facial recognition proposed by the council amounted to ""an unprecedented level of mass surveillance and it marks the end of privacy in the public space as we know it"". The live facial recognition cameras will be installed at crime hotspots and will ""match faces against a defined police database in real time"", the council said. A report from the council's cabinet says two cameras are proposed at 10 locations, including outside Shepherd's Bush Market on Uxbridge Road and Wood Lane outside Westfield Shopping Centre. However, introducing facial recognition cameras is ""heavily contingent on police support"", though the council's initial conversations have reportedly been positive. The Metropolitan Police currently has one pilot site for static live facial recognition cameras in Croydon, analysis of which is expected this autumn. There will also be AI capability for 500 cameras under Hammersmith and Fulham's (H&F) plans. According to the report, AI will ""enable more efficient video playback, automatic vehicle tracking and enable use of other tools that will make more effective use of the camera system"", increasing CCTV operator efficiency and response times. The report states: ""Importantly, this will enable Retrospective Facial Recognition (RFR) across H&F's camera network, allowing CCTV footage to be automatically searched to efficiently track the routes taken by criminals across the borough."" The cabinet paper also recommended drones be introduced as an ""enforcement aid"", subject to approval from the Civil Aviation Authority. LDRS Jasleen Chaggar from Big Brother Watch said the council was using facial recognition without safeguards 'Consequences of austerity' Jasleen Chaggar, legal and policy officer at Big Brother Watch, told BBC London: ""The council are really throwing the kitchen sink at their residents with these plans, with very little regard to their fundamental rights or freedoms. ""Not only do they want to subject their residents to 24-hour real-time identity checks through live facial recognition, they also want to capture that footage of them going about their everyday lives in order to review their movements and behaviours after the fact."" She added: ""There is no framework that's been promised, there's no legislation, and there's an ongoing legal challenge. ""Will the council use this to monitor fly tippers or enforce parking fines? There are no rules in place... and the council are using this without safeguards."" ""Having better evidence"" is the aim of the scheme, the council said Stephen Cowan, the leader of Hammersmith and Fulham Council, told cabinet members at a meeting on Monday: ""This council is pioneering the use of artificial intelligence to identify and recognise people who have committed crime or antisocial behaviour to a greater degree. ""As we know, the criminal justice system is broken. It has been broken for a long time. ""It's one of the many consequences of austerity, and as a consequence it is extremely difficult at times for the courts to get people taken through the courts.

In a letter shared on social media by fellow co-founder Ben Cohen, Mr Greenfield said the Cherry Garcia maker had lost its independence after Unilever put a halt to its social activism. His exit marks the latest episode in a row that started in 2021 when Ben & Jerry's said it would stop selling its ice cream in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. A spokesperson for The Magnum Ice Cream Company, which is being spun off from Unilever, said it was grateful to Mr Greenfield but disagreed with his stance. Ben & Jerry's has long been known for taking a public stance on social and political issues since it was founded in 1978, often backing campaigns on issues like LGBTQ+ rights and climate change. In his letter, Mr Greenfield said leaving the firm was ""one of the hardest and most painful decisions"" he had ever made but he could no longer ""in good conscience"" work for a business that had been ""silenced"" by Unilever. This was despite an agreement that protected the brand's social mission when it merged with the consumer goods giant 25 years ago, he said. Speaking to Radio 4, Ben Cohen said that ""Jerry has a really big heart and this conflict with Unilever was breaking it."" ""My heart leads me to continue to work inside the company to advocate for its independence so that it can actualise the social mission, the values that it was founded on and has maintained for over 40 years"", he told the PM programme. He added that Unilever ""has not been abiding by the terms of the acquisition agreement"" and that ""they've essentially been usurping the power of the independent board of directors which has legal authority over the social mission of the company, and now Magnum is proceeding in the same fashion. They've also been muzzling the company."" A spokesperson for The Magnum Ice Cream Company said the firm had been in dialogue with the two founders before Mr Greenfield's decision to leave. ""We disagree with his perspective and have sought to engage both co-founders in a constructive conversation on how to strengthen Ben & Jerry's powerful values-based position in the world,"" they said. Commenting on Mr Greenfield's announcement, Anna Macdonald, investment partner at Aubrey Investments, said Ben and Jerry's had ""built a brand all about irreverence and activism and advocacy"" and that Unilever had agreed to ""continue these missions"" when it bought the business in 2000. But in recent years, she said, Unilever may have attempted to rein in the company's activism, particularly with regard to Israel and Gaza. Earlier this year, the company accused Unilever of demanding that it stops publicly criticising US President Donald Trump. Ms Macdonald said Mr Greenfield ""has moved on because he doesn't want to be associated with what's happening now"".","Ben & Jerry's co-founder Jerry Greenfield has resigned after nearly 50 years, citing Unilever's suppression of the ice cream maker's social activism.  Greenfield's departure, announced in a letter shared by co-founder Ben Cohen, stems from a long-running dispute ignited by Ben & Jerry's 2021 decision to halt sales in Israeli settlements.  Greenfield claims Unilever, which acquired Ben & Jerry's in 2000, has violated an agreement protecting the brand's social mission, effectively silencing its outspoken stance on issues like LGBTQ+ rights and climate change.  While Unilever expresses gratitude but disagrees with Greenfield's assessment, Cohen alleges Unilever has undermined the company's independent board and muzzled its activism.  Analysts suggest Unilever's attempts to curb Ben & Jerry's activism, particularly regarding Israel and past accusations of silencing criticism of Donald Trump (denied by Unilever), contributed to Greenfield's resignation.  Cohen intends to remain, advocating for the brand's independence within Unilever.

Aileen Barrameda is planning to buy a house in Los Angeles in the coming months. Stubbornly high mortgage rates - twice what she locked in at the start of the coronavirus pandemic - are not putting her off. ""If I have the means to get in the market, I might as well get in now, because homes are just going to get more expensive,"" Aileen said. The cost of housing is a key concern among Americans and a political talking point. US President Donald Trump had raised hopes that interest rate cuts from the Fed would help Americans get mortgages. The average rate on the 30-year mortgage, the most popular home loan in the US, fell to 6.35% last week, according to Freddie Mac. This marked the largest weekly decline in the past year and the lowest level in 11 months. However, for buyers like Aileen, borrowing costs are not guaranteed to come down much more than they already have despite the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut on Wednesday. Aileen Barrameda Aileen Barrameda, who is looking to buy a house in Los Angeles, stands on a residential street in the US city. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions do not directly affect mortgage rates. But they do affect what banks charge each other to borrow money. That then influences what banks charge their own customers for loans such as mortgages as well as the interest rate they pay on savings. However, US banks had already cut mortgage rates in anticipation of the Fed rate cut that happened this week, meaning mortgage rates may not fall much further. Prospective home buyers waiting for substantially more easing might be disappointed. Fed chair Jerome Powell, speaking to journalists on Wednesday, said as much. ""Most analysts think it would have to be pretty big change in rates to matter a lot for the housing sector,"" he said, while acknowledging that lower interest rates might boost demand and help builders. Meanwhile, the risk of rising inflation could push mortgage rates up if banks anticipate this means the Fed will not cut rates any further any time soon. The Fed and other central banks tend to avoid cutting borrowing costs up if they feel inflation is too high. ""I do think that people are expecting a big impact from this,"" said Nicole Stewart, a real estate agent with Redfin in Boise, Idaho, referring to the Fed's rate cut this week. ""I've been trying to inform most of my buyers, as well as my sellers, that we've already seen the majority of what's going to happen."" Ms Stewart said a fall in mortgage rates over the past month has encouraged some buyers. Over the span of just one weekend earlier this month, Ms Stewart wrote four offers and put three deals under contract. ""A huge increase from anything in past few years"", she said. But the US housing market remains unaffordable for many people. That issue is unlikely to be resolved by future Fed decisions, or by the recent dip in mortgage rates. Many homeowners secured unusually low mortgage rates - in the 3% range - at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, which they are hesitant to give up by selling their home. As such, homeowners who might otherwise downsize are choosing to stay put, reducing the amount of housing available for purchase and driving up home prices. Roughly 80% of mortgage borrowers have locked in a rate below the current average of 6.35%, said Julia Fonseca, an associate finance professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. While every decline in mortgage rates helps loosen the market a little bit, there are no signs of substantial relief on the horizon, Ms Fonseca said. ""We might be still a long way from normalising these markets,"" she said. Kristin Carlson Kristin Carlson, a prospective first-time buyer in the Boise, Idaho area, stands on a residential street in Nampa, just outside of Boise.","Despite a recent drop in the 30-year mortgage rate to 6.35%—its lowest point in 11 months—the US housing market remains largely unaffordable.  While the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut offers a slight easing,  experts believe its impact on mortgage rates will be minimal, as banks preemptively lowered rates.  Prospective buyers hoping for significant relief may be disappointed.  Although the rate decrease has spurred some activity,  with real estate agent Nicole Stewart reporting a surge in sales, the limited impact is overshadowed by persistently high home prices and a shortage of inventory, fueled by homeowners reluctant to sell their low-interest-rate mortgages.  The high cost of housing continues to be a major concern for Americans, and this latest rate adjustment is unlikely to significantly change the long-term outlook.

Figures released on Tuesday, suggesting retirees will likely benefit from a 4.7% increase in the state pension from next April, will add a spring to those dancers' steps. Yet concerns remain. Glenys worries about those whose only income is the basic state pension. ""I do feel sorry for people that are struggling, if it's food or heat,"" she says. Meanwhile, former architect Mary says her children's generation are having to strive harder and for longer to afford to start a family or buy a home. ""My daughter's about to give birth, and she's beginning to contribute to a pension. But what it's going to be like for the new grandchild, I've no idea."" Glenys and Mary's reflections show not only the success of the triple lock system used to increase pensions but also raises questions around its fairness and its sustainability. The triple lock formula says that the state pension will rise in spring by the greater of 2.5%, the previous September's inflation rate, or the increase in average earnings registered over the previous summer. Because the earnings figure published on Tuesday morning is almost certain to be the highest of those three, it is likely the state pension will go up by 4.7% in April. The measure has helped to cut the number of pensioners living in poverty, but according to the minister who launched it, Sir Steve Webb, it's not job done yet. The UK's state pension is less generous than the average in rich countries, meaning we are more reliant on private savings. And the nature of the cost of living crisis of the past few years, centred on the staples like food and energy, has left those reliant on the state pension particularly stretched. It could get worse for some pensioners. The triple lock means the new state pension - for those who reached pension age after April 2016 - is creeping closer to the £12,570 threshold at which tax becomes payable. That threshold is set to be frozen until 2028, meaning people like former hairdresser Linda will soon likely end up paying income tax on their pension under current plans. ""You're given it in one hand and it's taken away in the other, so that's not a lot of good,"" she says. ""If they could raise the tax threshold, it would make a huge difference."" The state pension faces other issues. We are living longer and having fewer children, so the bill is booming and it is being footed by a falling share of the population. Already, funding the state pension accounted for almost £140bn in the last financial year, making it the second biggest claim on the public purse after health spending. And the amount spent is vulnerable to the kind of extremes in inflation we've seen in recent years, meaning it now costs about three times as much as its architects originally reckoned. Linda worries about having to pay tax on her state pension in the future Future sums threaten to be eyewatering. The government's own independent forecaster says that by 2070 the amount needed to fund the state pension will be equivalent to 7.7% of GDP - 50% higher than right now. That is quite an ask of taxpayers when other claims on the public purse are also projected to soar, in particular healthcare spending - largely for the same group of older Brits. As the costs mount, many economists say the triple lock might disappear. Keeping it going means shifting an increasing amount of resources from younger generations, workers and business owners, to older ones. The government has committed to keeping it in place for the rest of the parliament, but Pensions Minister Torsten Bell admitted in a previous role - as chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, a think tank that focuses on the plight of the lower paid - that the triple lock is a ""messy tool"". So what should replace it? In his previous job, Bell touted a system of increases that was shielded from spikes in inflation. Webb, who acknowledges the triple lock can't continue ""infinitely"", has mentioned a system of getting the pension to a certain proportion of average earnings – and then maintaining that. Others have floated the idea of linking it to inflation or earnings increases.","The UK's triple lock pension system, guaranteeing annual increases based on inflation, earnings, or 2.5%, faces a sustainability crisis.  While a projected 4.7% rise next April offers relief to pensioners like Glenys, concerns remain about its long-term affordability.  The system, credited with reducing pensioner poverty, is increasingly expensive, costing nearly £140 billion last year and projected to reach 7.7% of GDP by 2070. This rising cost, coupled with a shrinking working-age population and frozen tax thresholds impacting pensioners like Linda, fuels debate over its future.  While the government is committed to the triple lock until the next election, experts like former Pensions Minister Sir Steve Webb acknowledge its unsustainability.  Alternatives proposed include linking increases to average earnings or inflation, but no clear solution has emerged, leaving the future of the triple lock uncertain.

Video footage shows tanks, bulldozers and armoured personnel carriers moving on the edges of Sheikh Radwan, in northern Gaza City. Thick clouds of smoke can be seen as Israeli forces fire artillery shells and smoke bombs to cover their advance. The Sheikh Radwan district was home to tens of thousands of people before the war and is considered one of the city's most densely populated areas. Israel says the aim of its Gaza City offensive is to free hostages held by Hamas and defeat up to 3,000 fighters in what it describes as the group's ""last stronghold"" - but the operation has drawn widespread international condemnation. The leaders of more than 20 major aid agencies, including Save the Children and Oxfam, warned that ""the inhumanity of the situation in Gaza is unconscionable"". Residents in Sheikh Radwan said Wednesday's incursion followed a wave of heavy airstrikes targeting buildings and main streets across the neighbourhood, in what appeared to be preparation for the ground assault. Saad Hamada, a local resident who fled south with his family earlier on Wednesday, told the BBC: ""The drones didn't leave anything. They hit solar panels, power generators, water tanks, even the internet network. ""Life became impossible, and that is what forced most people to leave despite the danger."" Reuters The incursion into Sheikh Radwan has triggered yet another wave of displacement, with thousands of families fleeing south Sheikh Radwan includes the areas of Abu Iskandar, al-Tawam, and al-Saftawi, and is intersected by al-Jalaa Street, a vital artery linking central Gaza City with its northern districts. Locals say Israeli control of the neighbourhood could open the way for forces to advance deeper into the city and reach its central areas. The images of tanks in Gaza City's streets have caused widespread panic among residents, particularly those still living in the western and central parts of the city. Witnesses said the sight of tanks approaching their homes revived memories of previous incursions, that ended with entire neighbourhoods being flattened. The incursion into Sheikh Radwan has triggered yet another wave of displacement, with thousands of families fleeing south. Long lines of cars and carts loaded with belongings were seen on the roads, as the Israeli army opened a route to the south via the Salahedin Road. Residents reported journeys taking hours and costing hundreds of shekels due to the scarcity of transport and soaring prices. Getty Images The Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood has already suffered massive damage in the war Before the war, Sheikh Radwan was one of Gaza City's busiest districts, home to dozens of schools, mosques, and marketplaces. It had already been struck repeatedly by air raids in recent months, and there is widespread destruction, but the sight of tanks inside the area now marks a significant new phase in Israel's ground campaign. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced on Wednesday morning that it had struck more than 150 targets across Gaza City in two days in support of its ground troops. As part of its operations, the IDF is also reportedly utilising old military vehicles loaded with explosives that have been modified to be controlled remotely. They are being driven to Hamas positions and detonated, according to Israeli media. Resident Nidal al-Sherbi told the BBC Arabic's Middle East Daily programme: ""Last night was extremely difficult, with continuous explosions and shelling that lasted from night until dawn."" ""Israeli vehicles advanced from Sheikh Radwan, Tal al-Hawa, and also from Shejaiya. It was a very, very frightening night."" Aid groups, UN agencies and others say the ""humanitarian area"" people are expected to move to is heavily overcrowded and insufficient to support the roughly two million Palestinians who are expected to cram into it. Some who followed the military's orders to evacuate to the zone say they found no space to pitch their tents, so they returned north. ""Everyday leaflets are thrown at us ordering evacuation, while the Israeli army shells buildings in every direction,"" Munir Azzam, who is in northern Gaza, told the BBC. ""But where can we go? We have no refuge in the south."" The IDF said on Tuesday that around 350,000 people had fled Gaza City, while the UN put the figure at 190,000 since August. Estimates suggest at least 650,000 remain. Daniel Meron, Israel's ambassador to the UN, says Israel ""categorically rejects the libellous rant""","Israeli tanks have entered Sheikh Radwan, a densely populated residential area in northern Gaza City, marking a significant escalation in Israel's ground offensive.  This second day of the ground operation aims to free hostages held by Hamas and target what Israel calls the group's ""last stronghold,""  triggering widespread displacement as thousands flee south.  Residents report intense shelling and airstrikes preceding the ground assault, leaving much of the infrastructure destroyed.  The incursion, described by witnesses as terrifying, has revived fears of previous devastating incursions.  While Israel claims the operation protects its citizens, international condemnation is mounting, with aid agencies warning of an ""unconscionable"" humanitarian crisis.  The influx of displaced people into designated safe zones is overwhelming existing resources, leaving many with nowhere to go.  Estimates of those displaced vary, with the IDF claiming 350,000 and the UN around 190,000,  while hundreds of thousands remain in Gaza City under siege.  Israel denies accusations of racism and brutality.

The cost of food and non-alcoholic drinks grew at an annual rate of 5.1% as beef, butter, milk and chocolate prices continued to surge. However, despite the increase in food costs, price growth in other areas such as air fares slowed, leaving the overall rate of UK inflation at 3.8% - the same as July. Economists said food bills have been rising because supermarkets were passing on government increases in the minimum wage and National Insurance Contributions (NIC) to shoppers through higher prices. It also said that inflation in the UK was ""significantly higher"" than the estimates for large European economies such as France and Germany. In August, France's inflation was 0.8% while Germany recorded price growth of 2.1%. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said Britain had become ""an outlier in recent months on inflation compared to other major economies"". She said: ""Since April, the rise in inflation has been driven largely by domestic policy choices, including the increase in employers' National Insurance Contributions. ""These higher costs have been passed on by businesses to consumers, feeding through into higher headline inflation."" Some food items have continued to see particularly big increases. In the year to August, beef and veal prices were up nearly 25%, while butter prices grew by nearly 19% and chocolate rose by 15.4%. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said that food costs were outstripping average wage growth, which the ONS said reached 4.7% between May and July. ""With food inflation now outpacing wages, many families will be struggling with the rising cost of living,"" Kris Hamer, director of insight at the BRC, said. However, the prices of some goods such as clothing and footwear eased, which the BRC said was ""driven in part by retailers discounting the last of their summer collections"". It added: ""Key staples such as cereals and pasta fell in price on the month."" James Smith, developed market economist at investment bank ING, said the inflation figure was ""certainly not good news for the Bank of England"". He told the BBC that it remaining at 3.8% ""means the prospect for further interest rate cuts this year very much hang in the balance"". ""In terms of where we go from here, food inflation could climb a little bit higher into the end of the year,"" he added. The Bank of England has cut interest rates five times since August last year, taking borrowing costs to 4%. It has said it expects inflation to peak at 4% in September. The central bank is widely expected to hold interest rates on Thursday. It then has two further rate-setting meetings this year - in November and December. Even with a projected rise in inflation, Capital Economics said it doubts the Bank will cut rates in November. But Paul Dales, its chief UK economist, said: ""We still expect the looser labour market to weaken wage growth and eventually bring down UK inflation to similar rates as in the US and the eurozone, which will allow the Bank of England to cut rates from 4% now to 3% by the end of next year."" 'NICs rise has stung' Coosh Bakery co-founder and director Tom Egan says its costs have risen","UK inflation remains at 3.8%, but food prices surge 5.1%

UK inflation held steady at 3.8% in August, but food price inflation hit a five-month high of 5.1%, driven by increases in beef (nearly 25%), butter (nearly 19%), and chocolate (15.4%).  Economists attribute the food price surge to supermarkets passing on increased minimum wage and National Insurance contributions to consumers.  This contrasts sharply with lower inflation rates in France (0.8%) and Germany (2.1%).  The British Retail Consortium notes that food inflation exceeds wage growth (4.7% May-July), impacting household budgets. While some prices, such as clothing, fell due to discounting,  experts warn that further food price increases are possible before year's end. The Bank of England, which is expected to maintain interest rates at 3.8% this week, faces pressure as the higher inflation rate deviates significantly from other major economies.

The local authority is currently exploring the possibility of following other parts of the country and bringing in the so-called tourist tax which would then be invested in improving the area as a destination. Matthew Wallace Jr - director of the Cairndale Hotel and Spa in Dumfries - said he was ""strongly against"" any such move. A council statement said it would take on board any feedback received and no decision would be made until a full report was brought back next year. The Cairndale Hotel and Spa in Dumfries employs about 120 staff Earlier this year, councillors in Edinburgh and Glasgow approved a 5% charge on overnight stays in hotels, hostels, guest houses, B&Bs and self-catering accommodation. In August, councillors backed the introduction of a 7% visitor levy for Aberdeen. Councillors in the Shetland Islands recently decided against the move but Dumfries and Galloway Council (DGC) is one of a number of authorities still weighing up the option. It agreed earlier this month to take steps to explore the potential of the levy and promised widespread consultation. Mr Wallace - whose business employs about 120 staff - said the charge was not suitable for the south-west of Scotland. ""There is no over-tourism problem in Dumfries and Galloway,"" he said. He said supporters often cited cities like Barcelona and Venice and suggested that a ""nominal fee"" did not put people off. However, he said they benefitted from lower rates of VAT than the UK which made the levy ""more palatable"". ""This levy is just a further increase in taxation and makes our region needlessly more expensive,"" he said. ""Once a tourism levy is in place, one thing is certain. It will be here to stay and the rate or percentage will only ever increase. ""Business rates and VAT - paid by guests and business - should be ample funding for local government without hammering struggling businesses in the region with an additional tax."" Mr Wallace said the hospitality industry was already under pressure without the so-called tourist tax He said he believed it would not be a popular move. ""The effect will be quite simple,"" he said. ""The cost of accommodation across the board will increase and Dumfries and Galloway becomes a more expensive destination to visit. ""DGC should be directing efforts to encourage growth in tourism not introduce a tax that, from recent social media posts, nobody would seem to support."" He urged the local authority to ""fully engage"" with the sector. ""We are already doing all that we can to attract business to our region,"" he said, adding that the council should look at other avenues for revenue generation. ""The levy is not welcome in Dumfries and Galloway and by refusing to implement a levy, DGC has an opportunity to show the rest of Scotland, and further afield, that south west Scotland is open for business and welcomes tourism.""","Dumfries and Galloway Council is exploring a potential tourist tax, similar to those implemented in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen.  However, the plan faces opposition from local businesses, such as the Cairndale Hotel and Spa, which employs 120 staff.  Director Matthew Wallace Jr. argues that the levy would make the region unnecessarily expensive, deterring tourists and harming the hospitality sector already facing economic pressures. He points out the lack of overtourism in the area and suggests exploring alternative revenue streams instead of imposing an additional tax.  The council has pledged extensive consultation before making a final decision next year.

After months of economic debate and mounting attacks from US President Donald Trump, the US central bank cut interest rates on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve said it was lowering the target for its key lending rate by 0.25 percentage points. That will put it in a range of 4% to 4.25% - the lowest level since late 2022. The move - the bank's first rate cut since last December - is expected to kick off a series of additional reductions in the months ahead, which should help bring down borrowing costs across the US. But today's move carries a warning about the economy, reflecting increased consensus at the Fed that a stalling job market needs a boost in the form of lower interest rates. ""Unemployment is still low but we're seeing downside risks,"" Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said at a news conference after the announcement. That compared to the Fed's July update which described the job market as ""solid"". Wednesday's cut was supported by 11 of the 12 voting members on the Fed's commitee. Stephen Miran, who is on temporary leave from his post leading Trump's Committee of Economic Advisers, voted for a bigger 0.5 percentage point cut. In many ways, it is no surprise that the Fed, which sets interest rate policy independent of the White House, is cutting. The inflation that ripped through the post-pandemic economy and prompted the bank to raise interest rates in 2022 has come down significantly. In the UK, Europe, Canada and elsewhere, central banks have already responded with lower rates, while the Fed's own policymakers have said for months that they expected to lower borrowing costs by at least half a percentage point this year. At the Fed's last meeting, two members of the board even backed a cut. They were outvoted, as other members remained worried that Trump's economic policies, including tax cuts, tariffs and mass detentions of migrant workers, might cause inflation to flare back up again. And it's true that the US in recent months has seen inflation tick higher. Prices rose 2.9% over the 12 months to August, the fastest pace since January, and still above the Fed's 2% target. But in recent weeks, those concerns have been eclipsed by weakness in the labour market. The US reported meagre job gains in August and July and an outright loss in June - the first such decline since 2020. ""It really comes down to what we've seen in the jobs market - the deterioration that we've seen over the past few months,"" said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo, which is expecting rates to drop by 0.75 percentage points by the end of the year. ""The Fed knows that when the labour market turns, it turns very quickly, so they're wanting to make sure they're not stepping on the brakes of the economy at the same time the labour market has already slowed."" At the news conference following the announcement, Powell emphasised that the unemployment rate remained low, at 4.3%, while acknowledging unusual disagreement among members about what to do next. Forecasts released by the Fed suggest the central bank could lower interest rates by an additional 0.5 percentage points this year. But seven members see no further need for reductions, while one member - who analysts said was likely Miran - thinks the rate should drop below 3%. ""It's not a bad economy - we've seen much more challenging times,"" Powell said. ""But from a policy standpoint, it's challenging to know what to do. There are no risk-free paths right now. "" Wednesday's move is unlikely to satisfy the president, who has spent months blasting the Fed's hesitance to cut rates, which he says should be as low as 1%. On social media, he has called Powell ""a real dummy"", accusing him of holding back the economy by leaving interest rates too high for too long. ""Too Late"" MUST CUT INTEREST RATES, NOW, AND BIGGER THAN HE HAD IN MIND. HOUSING WILL SOAR!!!"" Trump wrote in a social media post ahead of the meeting, referring to Powell. Trump's pressure is not just rhetorical. He moved quickly to install Miran in time for this week's meeting after a short-term vacancy opened up last month. His administration has also threatened Powell with firing and investigation and is locked in a legal battle over its effort to fire economist Lisa Cook, another member of the board. To critics, Trump's moves amount to an assault on the Fed's independence that is unprecedented in recent history. Powell spent much of the news conference ducking questions about whether he agreed. Asked, for example, if he saw the fight over Cook as a threat to the bank's independence, he responded: ""I see it as a court case I think it would be inappropriate to comment on."" But whatever awkwardness in the air at this week's Fed meeting, analysts say they believe the Fed's decision to cut would have come regardless of Trump's campaign. ""The president's policies are certainly causing the economic activity that is forcing the hand of the Fed,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. ""The president's jawboning of the Fed to lower rates I think has had zero impact whatsoever.""","The Federal Reserve (Fed) cut its key interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to a range of 4% to 4.25%, its first rate cut since December.  This move, supported by 11 of 12 voting members, aims to stimulate the economy amid concerns about a slowing job market. While the unemployment rate remains low (4.3%), the Fed cited ""downside risks,"" contrasting with its previous assessment of a ""solid"" job market.  The cut, expected to be followed by further reductions, is a response to weak job growth in recent months.  However,  inflation, currently at 2.9%, remains above the Fed's 2% target.  The decision comes despite President Trump's repeated calls for much larger and more immediate rate cuts, and his ongoing pressure on the Fed, including the appointment of a new board member with White House ties.  While some analysts believe Trump's actions influenced the Fed's decision, others contend the rate cut was driven primarily by economic data.  The Fed's forecasts suggest further rate reductions are possible this year.

""Jimmy Kimmel Live will be pre-empted indefinitely,"" a spokesperson for the Disney-owned network said in a statement. Earlier this week, Kimmel said during his show that the ""Maga gang"" was trying to score political points off Kirk's killing. Kimmel did not comment to the BBC as he emerged shortly after the announcement from the television studio in Los Angeles. Celebrating the announcement, President Donald Trump said it was ""great news for America"". Kimmel said in his Monday night monologue: ""The Maga Gang desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it."" The late-night host also criticised flags being flown at half mast in honour of Kirk, and mocked US President Donald Trump's reaction to the shooting. ""This is not how an adult grieves the murder of someone he calls a friend. This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish,"" said Kimmel, who has often poked fun at Trump. On the day Kirk was shot, Kimmel took to Instagram to condemn the attack and send ""love"" to the 31-year-old activist's family. A suspect, 22, has since appeared in court charged with aggravated murder. Shortly after ABC announced Kimmel had been suspended, President Donald Trump wrote in a social media post: ""The ratings challenged Jimmy Kimmel Show is CANCELLED. Congratulations to ABC for finally having the courage to do what had to be done."" After he was taken off air, Kimmel left the show's studio on Hollywood Boulevard wearing a flannel shirt and cap and rode away in a car without comment. Fans of the show, who had been queuing up to join the live audience, expressed disappointment about the cancellation. Janna Blackwell, who was on holiday from Virginia, told the BBC: ""You know, this is getting ridiculous and stupid. ""Freedom of speech. He shared his opinion and is being cancelled. To me that is bizarre."" A small protest was also held outside the studio with a sign saying ""Trump must go now"". AFP via Getty Images The ABC announcement came just after one of the biggest owners of TV stations in the US, Nexstar Media, said it would not air Jimmy Kimmel Live! ""for the foreseeable future beginning with tonight's show"". Nexstar said the comedian's remarks about Kirk were ""offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse"". ""[We] do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located,"" said Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division. The chair of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Brendan Carr, thanked Nexstar ""for doing the right thing"" and said he hoped other broadcasters would follow its lead. Nexstar is currently seeking FCC approval for its planned $6.2bn merger with Tegna. Sinclair, the largest ABC affiliate group in the US, followed suit. It said it would air a special remembrance programme dedicated to Kirk this Friday during the original time slot for Kimmel's show. FCC head Carr, a Trump appointee, had earlier criticised Kimmel's monologue. The head of the US communications regulator said on Wednesday that the ABC host had shown ""the sickest conduct possible"" and he urged Disney to take action. ""[Broadcasters] have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest,"" the Trump appointee told the Benny Show, a conservative podcast. He noted that an apology from Kimmel would be a ""very reasonable, minimal step"". But Anna Gomez, the only Democratic member of the FCC, criticised Carr's remarks. She posted on X that ""an inexcusable act of political violence by one disturbed individual must never be exploited as justification for broader censorship or control"". The Writers Guild of America (WGA), Hollywood's labour union, condemned the decision to take Kimmel off air as a violation of constitutional free speech rights. ""Shame on those in government who forget this founding truth,"" it said in a statement. Sag-Aftra, another union, said the move was ""the type of suppression and retaliation that endangers everyone's freedoms"".","ABC has indefinitely pulled late-night host Jimmy Kimmel from the air following his controversial comments about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.  Kimmel’s monologue criticized those attempting to politicize Kirk's death and mocked President Trump's reaction.  This prompted outrage from conservatives, including President Trump who celebrated the decision.  Nexstar Media Group, a major TV station owner, and several ABC affiliates subsequently announced they would not air Kimmel's show, citing his remarks as ""offensive and insensitive.""  FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee, condemned Kimmel's comments and urged Disney to act.  However, the move has drawn criticism from free speech advocates, including the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA, who view it as censorship.  While Kimmel issued an apology, the indefinite suspension highlights a growing political divide and the ongoing debate surrounding free speech in media.

Progress on the rebuilt car park was revealed during a Luton Borough Council overview and scrutiny board meeting, which was discussing a review of the airport's sustainability report for 2024. Fire ripped through Terminal Car Park 2 at London Luton Airport in June 2023, grounding aeroplanes, disrupting travel and causing hundreds of thousands of pounds in damage. A multi-storey airport carpark that was destroyed by fire could reopen this autumn. He added there would be a review of parking and drop-off operations ""soon"". ""That will provide a further 1,900 parking spaces and will move the drop-off area closer to the terminal,"" he continued. About 1,352 vehicles were destroyed in the fire Presenting the report, planning consultant David Gurtler said: ""A key target for the airport operator is to increase the number of next generation aircraft."" He explained that these made up 60% of the aircraft based at Luton and were more fuel-efficient and quieter than the older models. The meeting was also told that passenger travel by sustainable modes was down from 38% in 2023 to 29% in 2024. The target is to reach 47% of passengers using sustainable travel by 2028. Mr Gurtler said: ""A drop of 9% is a concern, although this was partly because of the multi-storey car park fire in 2023. ""The drop-off zone was relocated, which was less convenient for people."" About 1,352 vehicles were destroyed in the blaze, which caused the building's partial collapse. Although an investigation concluded the fire was accidental, a report from Bedfordshire Fire & Rescue Service found a sprinkler system could have changed or limited the fire. The fire started in a diesel vehicle on the third flood of Car Park 2, but, because of wind blowing through the open-sided structure, it spread quickly. Mr Bradford told the board: ""It's been a difficult few years following the car park fire in terminal Car Park 2. ""But we responded really well as an organisation putting in temporary solutions,"" he explained. ""The car park has been rebuilt and is very near to completion.""","London Luton Airport's multi-story Car Park 2, destroyed in a June 2023 fire that damaged 1,352 vehicles, is nearing completion and expected to reopen this autumn.  The fire, which originated in a diesel vehicle, spread rapidly due to the car park's open-sided design and lack of effective sprinkler system, according to a Bedfordshire Fire & Rescue Service report.  While the airport's response was praised, the incident significantly impacted passenger travel, contributing to a drop in sustainable transport usage from 38% to 29% in 2024.  The airport aims to increase this to 47% by 2028,  concurrent with a planned increase in parking spaces and a redesigned drop-off zone.  The rebuild is also serving as a training ground for young people.  The airport is also focusing on increasing its fleet of more fuel-efficient next-generation aircraft, comprising 60% of its current operation.

The problem began on Wednesday, and led to ambulances being diverted away from Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry and Craigavon Area Hospital in County Armagh. The nature of the IT issue - which was declared a major incident - has not yet been explained, although it has been resolved, and the Department of Health has said an ""urgent investigation"" is under way. The trust continues to request that patients avoid coming to emergency departments (EDs) in its area ""unless absolutely necessary"". 'Complex issues' In its latest statement, which was issued at 22:00 BST on Wednesday, the Southern Health Trust confirmed that IT issues which caused disruption ""have been resolved and all systems have been restored"". ""We will be testing our systems overnight and they will be reconnected in a phased manner tomorrow (Thursday),"" it added. The trust said the cause of the outage is not suspected to be related to cyber issues. Although most planned surgeries and hospital appointments have been cancelled, the trust said its community services ""are expected to operate as normal"" on Thursday. Affected patients have been contacted and cancelled appointments are to be rescheduled as soon as possible, the trust added. Throughout the incident, the Southern Trust said it had prioritised emergency and critically ill patients, but it has asked people to still avoid coming to emergency departments ""unless absolutely necessary"". The Department of Health said it was ""made aware of a major incident"" relating to the Southern Health Trust's IT systems on Wednesday morning. It added that although the cause was not yet known, it was ""under urgent investigation to try to restore normal service as quickly as possible"". Google Ambulances were diverted from Craigavon Area Hospital on Wednesday as the incident took place The Southern Health Trust covers a number of hospitals and care centres across counties Armagh, Down and Tyrone. As well as Daisy Hill and Craigavon hospitals, it also runs the South Tyrone Hospital in Dungannon, Lurgan Hospital and St Luke's Hospital in County Armagh. Several patients arrived at hospitals on Wednesday expecting to receive treatment, only to find out their appointments had been cancelled at the last minute. In its latest statement, the Southern Trust said it was ""hugely grateful"" for the support of the ambulance service, other health trust and the wider health and social care system. ""It will take some time for normal business to be fully restored, and we sincerely apologise once again for the disruption,"" the trust added. 'It's really unfair' Naomi Muldrew's partner was due to get a biopsy on Thursday, but that appointment has had to be rescheduled. He had received a red flag referral meaning he should have been seen within 14 days, but the letter for his first appointment - on 21 August - arrived after that date and the appointment was missed, and Wednesday's IT failures have compounded the couple's worries. ""It's really unfair and they're just obviously not very well prepared for anything like this happening,"" Ms Muldrew said. ""It's just not good enough – people left worrying themselves sick for even longer now."" She said her partner had the day booked off work ""and obviously just wanted it done to get some sort of clarity"". ""Now he's just left hanging in limbo again."" 'We have to come back next week' Margaret West had been hoping to get a cast removed. Because of the outage, she'll now have to wait for longer. ""I had to be at the fracture clinic here at Daisy Hill at twenty past two and my cousin and his wife brought me and we got here just to be told that the whole system had broken down and there's no clinics this afternoon,"" she said. ""Now I have to put up with this for another week."" Staff 'coping very well' The Southern Trust's Medical Director, Stephen Austin, said the patients who were already in hospitals were being ""appropriately treated"" on Wednesday. He said the situation was ""more challenging"" than normal for his staff but he insisted they were ""very calm and coping very well"" with the disruption. ""Staff are doing workarounds to take care and make sure that patient care and safety is prioritised and that's our prime focus."" Stephen Austin from the trust said staff were using pens and paper to maintain patient records during the IT outage He added Southern Trust hospitals were helped by other health trusts which had accepted diverted ambulances. ""I've been very grateful to them, so that's just keeping patients safe, going forward."" Like all other trusts in Northern Ireland, the Southern Trust has recently moved to a new fully digitised system to manage patient records. Mr Austin admitted that because of the IT issue, staff resorted to using pens and paper as a fallback ""so we can keep good records and keep track of patients"". ""That's the way that doctors and nurses [were] able to work like that in the past and [they're] able to go back to that,"" he said. ""Bit of a challenge having gone with electronic, but they're quite comfortable with that.""","A major IT outage at the Southern Health Trust in Northern Ireland caused widespread disruption on Wednesday, leading to the cancellation of numerous appointments at hospitals including Daisy Hill and Craigavon.  Ambulances were diverted, and emergency departments urged patients to only attend if absolutely necessary.  While the Trust confirmed that systems have been restored and are undergoing phased reconnection, the cause of the ""complex issues"" remains under urgent investigation, with cyberattack ruled out.  Affected patients are being contacted to reschedule appointments, and community services are expected to operate normally.  While staff are coping, patients expressed frustration at cancelled appointments, including those with urgent needs.  The Trust apologized for the disruption and thanked supporting organizations.  The incident highlights challenges with the recent transition to a fully digital patient record system.

The young South Korean was certain it had nothing to do with him. He was in the US only for a few weeks on a short-term visa, he thought to himself. Then the armed agents burst into his room and ordered him outside. They handcuffed him, before attaching chains to his waist and ankles, and loaded him onto a bus bound for a detention centre. ""I panicked and my mind went blank. I felt sick,"" he told the BBC, now back home in South Korea. ""I couldn't understand why I was being treated like this."" Youngjin is one of more than 300 Korean workers who were detained in the US state of Georgia earlier this month, in one of the largest immigration raids of Donald Trump's presidency to date. He and others interviewed for this article didn't want to reveal their real names in order to protect their identity. BBC/ Hosu Lee Youngjin, picture, says he's still shaken by the ordeal 'Helicopters and drones… people with guns' US officials initially claimed the workers had been in the country illegally on incorrect visas, but eventually the two sides struck a deal allowing them to leave voluntarily without any penalties, so they could return to work there in the future. Most of the workers were in the US temporarily, helping to build an electric car battery plant run by two South Korean companies, Hyundai and LG – part of a US push to get foreign companies to invest and manufacture more in the states. LG said that many of its employees who were arrested had various types of visas or were under a visa waiver programme. And so they were especially shocked by the raid. ""We just came out for a brief break and I could see a lot of people, officials with guns. As Koreans, we just thought they were here to arrest criminals, but then, they suddenly started arresting us,"" said Chul-yong, who was also detained that day. He said they tried to explain who they were, but they were terrified: ""There were helicopters and drones, armoured vehicles… people with guns."" There were some officers pointing guns at workers, he claimed. ""You know those red lasers that come out of those guns? It was so shocking that some people were shivering in fear."" Even those who managed to share their visa details said they were arrested. ""I thought everything would be cleared up but instead, they suddenly shackled us,"" said Mr Kim, another worker detained, who only wanted to reveal his last name. Chul-yong said there was a shackle around his ankles and another around his waist, connected to handcuffs. ""It was so tight, I couldn't touch my face with my hands."" They all said they had no idea why this was happening, or where they were being taken. ""I later learned that I was detained at the Folkston ICE Processing Center,"" added Chul-yong, a software engineer. He had been planning to stay for about a month but was arrested on his sixth day there. How the massive immigration raid on a Georgia car plant unfolded 'It was freezing... the water smelt like sewage' Youngjin, an engineer and sub-contractor for LG, was scheduled to be there for five weeks to train staff to operate some of the specialist high-tech equipment. The 30-year-old was shaking, still visibly upset, as he described to the BBC being taken to the detention centre and locked in a room with 60-70 other people. ""I had a panic attack. I just stood there trembling,"" he said. The room was freezing, and the new detainees were not given blankets for the first two days, he added. ""I was wearing short sleeves, so I put my arms inside my clothes and wrapped myself in a towel to try to stay warm at night,"" he said. ""The worst part was the water. It smelt like sewage. We drank as little as possible."" The bunk beds were all taken, Chul-yong said, by the time he arrived, leaving him and others to find any empty spot to rest, even an empty desk where they could put their head down. ""We tried to sleep anywhere, really. It was really cold. There were people who found packaged bread, heated it up in the microwave, hugging it throughout the night."" For the first few days, Youngjin had no idea how long he would be held for. He feared it might be months. Only after some of the workers were able to meet lawyers and consular staff, did they realise their government was working with the US authorities to get them released. ""Even the US side feels it may have gone a bit too far,"" South Korea's chief trade negotiator told reporters after returning from the US. Seoul says it is now investigating potential human rights violations during the raid by US authorities. Trump acknowledged the need to have specialists from overseas train up US workers, and according to South Korean officials, US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau has expressed his ""deep regrets"" over the incident. Still, it has shaken relations between the US and South Korea, usually close allies, especially since it came hard on the heels of a trade deal in which South Korean companies pledged to invest $350bn in the US. BBC/ Hosu Lee Youngjin shows a red band that they put on before he was arrested, which indicated he had to be checked","Over 300 South Korean engineers working temporarily at a Georgia electric car battery plant were detained in a large-scale US immigration raid earlier this month.  The workers, employed by Hyundai and LG, described harrowing experiences, including being handcuffed, shackled, and held in freezing, unsanitary conditions at a detention center.  They allege that armed officers pointed guns at them, despite possessing valid visas or being under visa waiver programs.  While US officials initially claimed the workers were in the country illegally, a deal was reached allowing their release without penalty.  The incident, described as one of the largest immigration raids of the Trump presidency, has sparked outrage in South Korea and strained US-South Korean relations. Seoul is investigating potential human rights violations, and US officials have expressed regret.  The raid occurred despite a recent trade deal in which South Korean companies pledged significant investment in the US.

But since the rise of AI, the lawyer and legal technology consultant says her preferences have changed - she now turns to large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. ""For example, I'll ask it how I should decorate my room, or what outfit I should wear,"" says Ms Lahady, who lives in Montreal, Canada. ""Or, I have three things in the fridge, what should I make? I don't want to spend 30 minutes thinking about these admin tasks. These aren't my expertise; they make me more fatigued."" Ms Lahady says her usage of LLMs overtook Google Search in the past year when they became more powerful for what she needed. ""I've always been an early adopter… and in the past year have started using ChatGPT for just about everything. It's become a second assistant."" While she says she won't use LLMs for legal tasks - ""anything that needs legal reasoning"" - she uses it in a professional capacity for any work that she describes as ""low risk"", for example, drafting an email. ""I also use it to help write code or find the best accounting software for my business."" Ms Lahady is not alone. A growing number are heading straight for LLMs, such as ChatGPT, for recommendations and to answer everyday questions. ChatGPT attracts more than 800 million weekly active users, up from 400 million in February 2025, according to Demandsage, a data and research firm. Traditional search engines like Google and Microsoft's Bing still dominate the market for search. But LLMs are growing fast. According to research firm Datos, in July 5.99% of search on desktop browsers went to LLMs, that's more than double the figure from a year earlier. Getty Images ChatGPT attracts around 800 million weekly users Professor Feng Li, associate dean for research and innovation at Bayes Business School in London, says people are using LLMs because they lower the ""cognitive load"" - the amount of mental effort required to process and act on information – compared to search. ""Instead of juggling 10 links with search, you get a brief synthesis that you can edit and iterate in plain English,"" he says. ""LLMs are particularly useful for summarising long documents, first-pass drafting, coding snippets, and 'what-if' exploration."" However, he says outputs still require verification before use, as hallucinations and factual errors remain common. While the use of AI might have exploded, Google denies that it is at the expense of its search engine. It says overall queries and commercial queries continued to grow year-over-year and its new AI tools significantly contributed to this increase in usage. Those new tools include AI Mode, which allows users to ask more conversational questions and receive more tailored responses in return. That followed the rollout of AI Overviews, which produces summaries of queries at the top of the search page. While Google plays down the impact of LLMs on its search business, an indication of the affect came in May during testimony in an antitrust trial bought by the US Department of Justice against Google. A top Apple executive said that the number of Google searches on Apple devices, via its browser Safari, fell for the first time in more than 20 years. Nevertheless, Prof Li doesn't believe there will be a replacement of search but a hybrid model will exist. ""LLM usage is growing, but so far it remains a minority behaviour compared with traditional search. It is likely to continue to grow but stabilise somewhere, when people primarily use LLMs for some tasks and search for others such as transactions like shopping and making bookings, and verification purposes."" Getty Images Apple says Google searches on Apple devices via the Safari browser are falling As a result of the rise of LLMs, companies are having to change their marketing strategies. They need to understand ""which sources the model considers authoritative within their category,"" says Leila Seith Hassan, chief data officer at digital marketing agency Digitas UK. ""For example, in UK beauty we saw news outlets and review sites like Vogue and Sephora referenced heavily, whereas in the US there was more emphasis on content from brands' own websites."" She says that LLMs place more trust in official websites, press releases, established media, and recognised industry rankings than in social media posts. And that could be important, as Ms Seith Hassan says there are signs that people who have used AI to search for a product, are more likely to buy. ""Referrals coming directly from LLMs often appear to be higher quality, with people are more likely to convert to sales.""","Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are increasingly challenging Google's search engine dominance.  While traditional search engines still hold market share, LLM usage is rapidly expanding.  Data shows a significant rise in LLM usage, with one study reporting a 5.99% share of desktop browser searches in July, more than double the previous year.  ChatGPT alone boasts over 800 million weekly active users. This shift is attributed to LLMs' ability to reduce cognitive load by providing concise, easily editable summaries and answers, streamlining tasks like drafting and coding.  However, experts caution that LLM outputs require verification due to potential inaccuracies.  While Google maintains overall search growth, fueled by its own AI tools, a decline in Google searches on Apple devices suggests a tangible impact from LLMs.  Experts predict a future hybrid model where both LLMs and traditional search coexist, with LLMs handling specific tasks and search engines remaining crucial for transactions and bookings.  The rise of LLMs is also forcing marketing strategies to adapt, focusing on building authority and credibility with sources favored by these models.

""This is a responsible target supported by science and a practical plan to get there, built on proven technology,"" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said when unveiling the new target on Thursday. The nation - which has faced global criticism for its continued reliance on fossil fuels - had previously pledged to reduce greenhouse gases by 43% by 2030. Australia, one of the world's biggest polluters per capita, will aim to cut its carbon emissions by at least 62% compared to 2005 levels over the next decade. Setting a target to reduce emissions from 2005 levels is part of Australia's obligation under the Paris Climate Agreement. The new target is in line with an emission reduction benchmark – of between 62% and 70% – that was recommended by the Climate Change Authority, a government body which provides climate policy advice, Albanese said. The prime minister will confirm the commitment at a meeting of the UN General Assembly in New York later this month. The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement saw world leaders agree to keep global temperatures from rising 1.5C above those of the late 19th Century, which is seen as crucial to preventing the most damaging impacts of climate change. Australia, like much of the world, has faced an increasing number of climate-related weather extremes in recent years including severe drought, historic bushfires and successive years of record-breaking floods. Warmer seas have also caused mass bleaching at its world-famous Great Barrier Reef in Queensland and Ningaloo Reef in Western Australia. On Monday, a report into the impact of climate change - the first of its kind in the country - found Australia had already reached warming of above 1.5C and that no community would be immune from ""cascading, compounding and concurrent"" climate risks. It warned that if the government failed to take stronger action there would be more heatwave-related deaths, poorer water quality due to severe flooding and bushfires, and sea level rises that would threaten 1.5 million people. It also warned of a A$611bn ($406bn; £300bn) drop in property values as a result of such threats. However, Australia's climate agenda and its ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 remain divisive political topics. The country's opposition party, the Liberal National coalition, is internally debating whether it should continue to support the net zero emissions goal, while other parliamentarians - including many independent and Greens MPs - are calling for faster cuts. Opposition leader Sussan Ley on Thursday said the coalition was ""dead against"" the new target, saying that it failed on both ""cost and credibility"". Shortly after Albanese's Labor government was elected in 2022 it set higher climate targets, up from the conservative coalition's previous target of between 26% and 28%. It has sought to make Australia a ""renewable energy superpower"", but has also continued to approve fossil fuel projects. Last week, one of the country's largest gas projects - Woodside's North West Shelf - was given the greenlight to keep operating for another 40 years until 2070, in a move that was widely condemned by climate experts and environmental advocates. Australian Greens Larissa Waters labelled the move a ""betrayal"" by Labor.","Australia significantly boosted its 2035 emissions reduction target to at least 62% below 2005 levels, a move announced by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.  This follows a government-commissioned report highlighting the escalating risks of extreme weather events due to climate change, including potential A$611 billion in property value losses.  While the new target aligns with recommendations from the Climate Change Authority and strengthens Australia's commitment under the Paris Agreement, it faces political opposition.  The Liberal National coalition opposes the target, citing cost and credibility concerns,  despite the government's stated aim to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and its pursuit of becoming a renewable energy superpower.  This latest announcement comes amidst ongoing criticism for Australia's continued approval of fossil fuel projects, including recently extending the lifespan of a major gas project, a decision drawing condemnation from environmental groups.

Just days earlier, the Dalit (formerly known as untouchables) woman, who earned her living bottling fruit juices in a village in Malappuram district, had complained of nothing more alarming than dizziness and high blood pressure. Doctors prescribed pills and sent her home. But her condition spiralled with terrifying speed: uneasiness gave way to fever, fever to violent shivers, and on 5 September - the main day of the festival - Sobhana was dead. The culprit was Naegleria fowleri - commonly known as the brain-eating amoeba - an infection usually contracted through the nose in freshwater and so rare that most doctors never encounter a case in their entire careers. ""We were powerless to stop it. We learnt about the disease only after Sobhana's death,"" says Ajitha Kathiradath, a cousin of the victim and a prominent social worker. In Kerala this year, more than 70 people have been diagnosed and 19 have died from the brain-eating amoeba. Patients have ranged from a three-month-old to a 92-year-old man. Normally feeding on bacteria in warm freshwater, this single-cell organism causes a near-fatal brain infection, known as primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). It enters through the nose during swimming and rapidly destroys brain tissue. Kerala began detecting cases in 2016, just one or two a year, and until recently nearly all were fatal. A new study has found only 488 cases have been reported globally since 1962 - mostly in the US, Pakistan and Australia. And 95% of the victims have died from the disease. Universal Images Group via Getty Images Naegleria fowleri, or the brain-eating amoeba, lives in lakes, rivers and hot springs But in Kerala, survival appears to be improving: last year there were 39 cases with a 23% fatality rate and this year, nearly 70 cases have been reported with about 24.5% mortality. Doctors say the rise in numbers reflects better detection, thanks to state-of-the-art labs. ""Cases are rising but deaths are falling. Aggressive testing and early diagnosis have improved survival - a strategy unique to Kerala,"" said Aravind Reghukumar, head of infectious diseases at the Medical College and Hospital in Thiruvananthapuram, the state's capital. Early detection allows customised treatment: a drug cocktail of antimicrobials and steroids targeting the amoeba can save lives. Scientists have identified around 400 species of free-living amoebae, but only six are known to cause disease in humans - including Naegleria fowleri and Acanthamoeba, both of which can infect the brain. In Kerala, public health laboratories can now detect the five major pathogenic types, officials say. The southern state's heavy reliance on groundwater and natural water bodies makes it particularly vulnerable, especially as many ponds and wells are polluted. A small cluster of cases last year, for example, was linked to young men vaping boiled cannabis mixed with pond water - a risky practice that underscores how contaminated water can become a conduit for infection. Kerala has nearly 5.5 million wells and 55,000 ponds - and millions draw their daily water from wells alone. That sheer ubiquity makes it impossible to treat wells or ponds as simple ""risk factors"" - they are the backbone of life in the state. ""Some infections have occurred in people bathing in ponds, others from swimming pools, and even through nasal rinsing with water which is a religious ritual. Whether in a polluted pond or a well, the risk is real,"" says Anish TS, a leading epidemiologist. Nebula NP A warning sign at a Kerala pond prohibiting swimming after a woman's death from amoebic meningoencephalitis So public health authorities have tried to respond at scale: in a single campaign at the end of August, 2.7 million wells were chlorinated. Local governments have put up sign boards around ponds warning against bathing or swimming and evoked the Public Health Act to enforce regular chlorination of swimming pools and water tanks. But even with such measures, ponds cannot realistically be chlorinated - fish would die - and policing every village water source in a state of more than 30 million people is unworkable. Officials now stress awareness over prohibition: households are urged to clean tanks and pools, use clean warm water for nasal ablutions, keep children away from garden sprinklers and avoid unsafe ponds. Swimmers are advised to protect their noses by keeping their heads above water, using nose plugs and avoiding stirring up sediment in stagnant or untreated freshwater. Yet, striking a balance between educating the public about real risks - of using untreated freshwater - and avoiding fear that could disrupt daily life is challenging. Many say despite guidelines issued for more than a year, enforcement remains patchy. ""This is a difficult problem. In some places [hot springs], signs are posted to warn of the possibility of the amoebae in the water source. This is not practical in most situations since the amoebae can be present in any source of untreated water [lakes, ponds, pools],"" Dennis Kyle, a professor of infectious diseases and cellular biology at the University of Georgia, told the BBC. ""In more controlled environments, frequent monitoring for proper chlorination can significantly reduce chances of infection. These include pools, splash pads and other man-made recreational water activities,"" he said. Abhishek Chinnappa/Getty Images Kerala has nearly 5.5 million wells and 55,000 ponds","Kerala, India, is battling a surge in cases of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), caused by the brain-eating amoeba *Naegleria fowleri*.  Over 70 cases have been reported this year, with a mortality rate around 24.5%, significantly higher than previous years. While the increase partly reflects improved detection capabilities, aggressive testing and early treatment with a cocktail of antimicrobials and steroids are improving survival rates.  The amoeba thrives in warm freshwater sources, and Kerala's heavy reliance on untreated wells and ponds, coupled with contaminated water sources, contributes to the problem. Public health initiatives include mass well chlorination and awareness campaigns emphasizing safe water practices, such as avoiding untreated water in nasal passages and protecting noses while swimming.  However, challenges remain in enforcing preventative measures across the vast state, highlighting the ongoing struggle to balance public health interventions with the realities of daily life in a region heavily dependent on natural water sources.

Organisers Stop Trump Coalition - a group of more than 50 unions and charities - marched from central London's Portland Place towards Whitehall at around 15:00 BST. Some protesters carried signs with slogans written across them including ""no to racism"", ""no to Trump"" and ""stop arming Israel"". Others carried smaller versions of the 20ft Trump Baby blimp that floated through crowds during protests against the president's first state visit in 2019. The Metropolitan Police estimated that up to 5,000 people were in attendance. More than 1,600 police officers had been deployed including 500 from other forces, the force said. Earlier on Wednesday, the Met Police's Deputy Assistant Commissioner, Louise Puddefoot, said it would be ""another busy day"" for officers. This protest came just days after the Unite the Kingdom protest. She added that police had been in ""close contact"" with the organisers and had asked all taking part to be ""considerate to the local community"" and keep disruption to a minimum. The Stop Trump Coalition includes groups ranging from climate campaigners to anti-racism groups and pro-Palestine organisations. Ahead of the march, a spokesperson for the coalition said: ""A government that will bow down to Trump and to racism is one that will open the door to fascism."" Although Trump was not visiting Parliament, the protest groups said they would demonstrate to ""defeat the politics of Trumpism"" and to promote ""an alternative, democratic vision of the world based on peace, social justice and international cooperation"". In the midst of the crowds - which started gathering near BBC Broadcasting House - people told the BBC why they were there, racking up a long list of grievances against the US president. They said they found him ""despicable"" and wanted to send a message that he was not welcome. Reverend Poppy Hughes, who was asked about those who said vicars should be apolitical, replied: ""Jesus preached peace and compassion and that's why I'm here"". Reverend Poppy Hughes came because of the teachings of Jesus Zoe Gardner, a political commentator and one of the organisers of Wednesday's protest, said that Trump ""represents everything that we hate"". ""We want our government to show some backbone, and have a little bit of pride and represent that huge feeling of disgust at Donald Trump's politics in the UK,"" she added. Climate campaigner Auriel Dowty Glanville from Wimbledon said she was demonstrating because she believed the president was a ""climate denier"" and climate change was ""the biggest threat facing us on Earth"". She called the second state visit invite ""appalling"", adding: ""It's all about the trade deal."" Auriel Dowty Glanville has dressed up with her take on the Statue of Liberty for the protest Sarah Montgomery and Claudio Solano, from North London, arrived in white protective face masks that read ""Trump stinks"". They said they had had the masks since Trump's first state visit. ""He still stinks,"" Ms Montgomery said. ""Everything he stands for stinks."" Mr Solano, from Brazil, said he disagreed with both Trump's policies and his support for Brazil's former right-wing leader Jair Bolsonaro. ""It is disgusting, and I don't understand why Britain has to be so cowardly,"" he added. As the crowd moved, it paused outside Downing Street, which was being protected by officers from Wales and Northern Ireland. Some of the demonstrators carried signs including ""Duck Off Donald"" and ""Feed him to the Corgis"". At Parliament Square - where the march stopped - a number of people took to a stage. There was a performance from singer Billy Bragg. Other speakers included former Labour MPs Jeremy Corbyn and Zarah Sultana, comedian Nish Kumar, and Green Party leader Zack Polanski.","Thousands protested in London against Donald Trump's UK state visit.  Organized by the Stop Trump Coalition, the demonstration drew an estimated 5,000 participants who marched from Portland Place to Whitehall, voicing concerns about Trump's policies on racism, Israel, and climate change.  Protesters displayed signs and smaller versions of the infamous ""Trump Baby"" blimp from his previous visit.

The Silver-washed Fritillary was recorded at Havannah and Three Hills Nature Reserve in Hazlerigg, near Newcastle's border with Northumberland, by local Chris Barlow in August. The Natural History Society of Northumbria said the butterfly had not been seen in the county since 1850. Stephen Kirtley, from charity Butterfly Conservation, said the species had become extinct in the North East in the 19th Century, but its numbers were growing again, especially in County Durham and Teesside. Mr Kirtley said he hoped the Silver-washed Fritillary would grow its presence in south Northumberland and start spreading further north. However, he said the butterfly that was spotted at Havannah and Three Hills Nature Reserve was male and it would not create a colony itself. Chris Barlow The butterfly's return to the region has been celebrated The Silver-washed Fritillary is more widespread in Wales and southern England. Its last sightings in the North East were in the 1850s. It was not spotted again until 2017, when it was recorded in Wynyard Country Park, near Stockton. The species has since been seen near Durham city and Castle Eden, with about 14 sightings recorded this year so far, up from 10 in 2024. ""Perhaps at some stage in the mid-19th Century it became too cool for the butterfly to survive here,"" Mr Kirtley said. ""Or perhaps changes in land management and woodland management meant that the places where it used to be found in the 1850s and before were no longer suitable and it's not been found in this area. ""I strongly suspect and believe that because of climate warming, the butterfly has started to move north and is able to use habitat in our area that up until recently wasn't suitable for it."" Stephen Kirtley The butterfly has been spotted more regularly in County Durham since 2017 Councillor Alex Hay, deputy leader and cabinet member for neighbourhoods at Newcastle City Council, which looks after Havannah and Three Hills Nature Reserve, said the butterfly's return to the north was ""a powerful indicator"" of the impact of conservation and habitat restoration efforts. ""It's a proud moment for the city and a reminder of the importance of protecting our natural environment for future generations,"" Hay added.

More on this story 'Concerning drop' in number of butterfly species","A Silver-washed Fritillary butterfly, unseen in Northumberland since 1850, has been spotted at Havannah and Three Hills Nature Reserve near Newcastle.  This marks a significant return for the species, believed extinct in the North East during the 19th century. While its numbers are growing in County Durham and Teesside, this sighting is a male and won't establish a colony alone. Experts attribute the northward expansion to climate change, making previously unsuitable habitats viable.  The sighting, one of over a dozen this year, is hailed as a conservation success, highlighting the positive impact of environmental protection efforts.

Across the floor and walls sprawl grand mosaics and sculptures depicting lions, piles of gold, thunderbolts and ancient Roman gods. ""When this building was created, it was designed as a working bank building. There were people coming and going all day,"" explains the Bank of England Museum's curator, Jenni Adam. ""And immediately they were greeted with this sense of grandeur along with lots and lots of messages about what's happening in this site."" Bank of England Museum. Photo by Monica A Walker Vadillo The parlours of the first floor have a very different atmosphere to the rooms on the floor below One hundred years ago work began to rebuild the Bank of England - a place which had started as a townhouse in the 1700s and expanded over subsequent centuries. To mark this centenary a new exhibition has begun in the bank's museum revealing more about what can be found inside one of Britain's most secure buildings. Ahead of its opening the BBC was given a rare look inside the bank itself, where some of the country's key financial decisions are made and which houses some 400,000 bars of gold in its basement vaults. The Print Collector via Getty Images Sir John Soane introduced the windowless wall in the 1800s which still surrounds the site Corbis via Getty Images Attempts were made to reproduce the grand banking halls of Soane's bank in the redevelopment The bank was first granted a Royal Charter in 1694 when it was ""founded for the use and benefit of the public as a way to manage the national debt and maintain stable finances in Britain"", says Ms Adam. It proved to be a huge success and by 1734 had moved to its current position in Threadneedle Street, with the premises becoming grander and slowly swallowing up surrounding land to cover a three-and-a-half acre (14,000 sq m) site within a windowless wall. Various renowned architects worked on the bank including Sir John Soane in the 1800s, with his building considered one the jewels of the City. However, by the first decades of the 20th Century, Soane's magnificent work was no longer proving fit for purpose. ""By the First World War the staff at the bank had gone from about 1,200 in 1914 to around 4,000 by 1918 and it was clear that there was a real capacity problem,"" says Ms Adam. ""It was doing a colossal job of managing an expensive national debt among many different aspects so it was decided to demolish and rebuild."" Bank of England Museum The bank continued to operate on the site throughout the 14-year project to rebuild it Despite efforts to retain much of its historic character, the 14-year project proved controversial with one architectural expert branding the demolition ""the greatest architectural crime to befall London in the 20th Century"". Even so, upon its completion in 1939 the project led by chief architect Sir Herbert Baker had cost a total of £5m - the equivalent of nearly £285m today - with no expense spared in the creation of the country's central bank. Evidence of such wealth can be seen throughout a development which rises seven floors high and three below. On the ground floor, mosaics by acclaimed Russian artist Boris Anrep spread along a maze of domed grey and black corridors, with figures and sculptures covering the fixtures and fittings throughout. Bank of England Museum A large mosaic featuring two lions protecting a column of gold stands in the centre of the entrance hall while depictions of the Roman god Mercury are everywhere Golden lions - symbolising security - pop up across the space, from specially designed lighting to staircase bannisters, while even the door handles are miniature recreations of Mercury, the Roman deity of communication and finance. ""There's a real blend of modern and ancient. It gives you the sense that even though this building is relatively new, it's been here forever,"" explains Ms Adam. ""There's a long legacy, a long heritage. You can trust it, it's going to stick around."" There is also a sign of an even older legacy at the bottom of one long spiralling staircase, where a Roman mosaic that was discovered in the 1930s remains on display. Roman mosaics and numerous other artefacts from the time were found during building work With grand banking halls based on those from Soane's building hidden off the corridor, occasional echoing thuds and bangs are the main reminder of the working nature of the building. This enterprise also carries on up another set of staircases but in a very different, almost regal atmosphere. One space, the first floor anteroom, is lined with red and gold silk, with centuries-old paintings hanging on the walls and an elaborately decorative fireplace standing beside a huge floor-to-ceiling window. Leading off it are a thick set of wooden double-doors that head into a plush pale blue octagonal room where a portrait of a past governor glares down upon a reproduction of a room created in the 1780s. Without the microphones placed around a curving table and two TV screens, few would consider this somewhere where discussions are held each month that have ramifications for millions of people. ""This is where to the present day, the bank's monetary policy committee meets to make decisions about rates as part of the bank's remit to manage inflation. ""That's why you want the double doors to make sure that nobody is listening into these very important market sensitive conversations,"" Ms Adam explains. Bank of England Museum. Photo by Monica A Walker Vadillo The first floor ante room houses artworks telling the changing story of the bank Bank of England Museum. Photo by Monica A Walker Vadillo Decisions on the Bank of England's interest rate are made each month in the committee room The feel of a grand old building spotted with hints of modernity continues around the floor, with many of the stone elements from the previous bank-like fireplaces and columns reused by Baker. Through another set of double doors is the court room, where a branded lectern stands in front of an 18th Century fireplace beneath an elaborate green ceiling and walls lined with gold. Silhouettes of monarchs from across the lifetime of the bank line the room, while gilded griffins protect piles of gold above the doorways. A wind vane also swings mechanically on one wall recalling a time when London's port was almost on the bank's doorstep and was such a key element of the city's economy. ""There's just lots of the symbolism of money and finance throughout the space... and gild as far as the eye can see,"" adds the museum curator. The court room is used for activities like large meetings and formal receptions The need for tight security means that tours of the building are incredibly rare. The only sight of any of the gold are the two bars held within the museum that are owned by the bank itself. It's why Ms Adam says she's so pleased to be able to put on an exhibition to ""open up the architecture"" and give people an idea of what's inside. ""I've been working in the bank for 15 years and when you come in here every day, it becomes normal,"" she says. ""However, every so often you do go around and think 'this is so spectacular' - and there's just so many stories and details to share."" Bank of England Museum.

Eleven charges of aggravated indecent assault - deemed more serious as they allegedly related to people under his authority - were downgraded on Thursday. Some charges were also dropped altogether. Mr Jones now faces 27 charges which allege that he indecently assaulted or groped nine men over two decades. Prosecutors have downgraded some of the most serious sex abuse charges against veteran broadcaster and former Wallabies coach Alan Jones after a court hearing on Thursday. Deputy Chief Magistrate Sharon Freund said there was a reformation of the case after two alleged victims withdrew, though there was no explanation as to why they were no longer part of the case. Mr Jones now faces 25 counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual touching. His lawyer Bryan Wrench told the court the dropped charges was a ""very big development"" and ""significant concession,"" according to the reports from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""There is no suggestion that... he had these complainants in his authority. He did not have any power over these complainants,"" Mr Wrench said. Police have previously said some of the alleged victims knew the radio titan personally, and that at least one had been employed by him. Others were allegedly assaulted the first time they met him, NSW Police's Michael Fitzgerald told reporters late last year. Speaking to journalists outside court in December, Jones told reporters the allegations were either ""baseless"" or ""distort the truth"". A former teacher, Mr Jones coached Australia's national rugby union team between 1984 and 1988, before pivoting to a radio career. He also, at times, worked as a speechwriter and advisor for Liberal Party figures - including former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser - and launched several failed bids to represent the party in both state and federal politics. A staple of Sydney airwaves on local station 2GB for decades, Mr Jones juggled those duties with TV commentary gigs before he retired from full time work in 2020 citing health issues. The broadcaster is a polarising figure, for years boasting one of the nation's biggest audiences but often courting controversy. He made headlines in 2012 for suggesting that then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard's father had ""died of shame"", and in 2019 faced a massive advertiser boycott after saying someone should ""shove a sock"" down the throat of New Zealand's leader at the time, Jacinda Ardern. Mr Jones has also been successfully sued for defamation many times.","Veteran Australian broadcaster Alan Jones, 84, will face a reduced number of indecent assault charges after a court hearing.  Initially facing 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault and other charges, the most serious allegations were downgraded, and some charges were dropped entirely following the withdrawal of two alleged victims.  Jones now faces 25 counts of indecent assault and two counts of sexual touching. His lawyer argued the dropped charges represented a significant concession, emphasizing that the remaining allegations do not involve complainants under Jones' authority.  Jones, a prominent and controversial figure in Australian media and politics, denies all allegations. He will appear in court again in January.

He asks, ""with that in mind, will she tell us when was the last time she called out Keir Starmer's lack of movement on fair funding, and how did he respond?"" Eluned Morgan replies ""my priorities are going to be the priorities that were set for me when I first became first minister. I think it's the daily lives of people and how we improve them is what we should be focused on rather than constantly looking at constitutional changes, which seems to be the obsession of his party. What is important, of course, is that we ask for more. I will always ask for more from whatever government there is in the United Kingdom."" Rhun ap Iorwerth says the upcoming UK government budget on 26 November is ""Labour's opportunity to prove once and for all that it is serious about addressing the way in which the Welsh government is resourced"". He calls on Labour to include in its Senedd election manifesto ""an explicit pledge to scrap the Barnett formula"". The first minister says ""we're in a position where we're still working up the manifesto, but we've always said we want to see a reform of the Barnett formula. There's nothing new there. There's nothing revolutionary there. We'll still keep making the same case. I think it is important for people in the country to recognise that what we've had is a £1.6 billion uplift as a result of a Labour government in Westminster, which is transforming lives in this country."" On 25 June 2025, Senedd members agreed to a Plaid Cymru motion proposing that the Senedd: ""1. Believes the current funding model for Wales, based on the Barnett formula, is outdated and unfair. ""2. Calls on the Welsh government to make representations to the UK government to replace the Barnett formula with a new, fair funding settlement for Wales."" The Barnett formula was put in place in the late 1970s - it was intended to be a temporary fix. Even its creator, Lord Barnett who died in 2014, said in the years before his death that the system was ""unfair"" and needed reform. Under the formula, extra funding - or cuts - from Westminster is allocated according to the population size of each nation and which powers are devolved to them. When the UK government increases or decreases funding for departments such as health and education in England, the Barnett formula is used to decide how much devolved governments will receive. It is controversial because it often leads to public spending per head being considerably different in different parts of the UK.","Welsh First Minister Eluned Morgan faced criticism from Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth for insufficient action on securing fairer funding for Wales.  Ap Iorwerth pressed Morgan on her failure to publicly challenge Keir Starmer's perceived inaction on reforming the Barnett formula, a system deemed outdated and unfair by many, including its creator.  While Morgan reiterated her commitment to improving the lives of Welsh citizens, ap Iorwerth urged the Labour party to include a pledge to scrap the Barnett formula in its Senedd election manifesto.  Morgan responded that the manifesto was still under development but confirmed their ongoing pursuit of Barnett formula reform.

How microbes control your sleep,"Scientists want to use the bacteria living in your gut and mouth to help you sleep better at night. As you lie in bed tonight, your body will be a teeming mass of activity. Across almost every inch of you – and inside you too – billions of tiny organisms are writhing and jostling for space. But if that horrifying thought is likely to keep you up at night, consider this: they might also help you get a better night's sleep. Emerging research suggests that the communities of bacteria, viruses and fungi that make up our body's microbiota can influence our sleep. Depending on the composition of our personal microbial ecosystem, the amount of shut eye we get can either improve or deteriorate. And tantalisingly, it could offer new ways of tackling sleep-related conditions caused by a disrupted body clock, described by sleep scientists as circadian rhythms. While many people currently rely on sleeping pills to quell persistent insomnia, the future might see friendly bacteria deployed to help us nod off, and even address obstructive sleep apnoea, a condition in which people struggle to breathe normally while asleep. It would bring new meaning to the term ""sleep hygiene"". ""The predominant theory for a long time has been that having sleep disorders is disruptive to our microbiomes,"" says Jennifer Martin, a University of California Los Angeles professor of medicine and board member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. ""But some of the evidence we're seeing now indicates that it's probably a relationship that goes in both directions.""","Gut and mouth bacteria may hold the key to better sleep, suggests emerging research.  Scientists are exploring the link between the body's microbiota (bacteria, viruses, and fungi) and sleep quality, finding that its composition may influence sleep patterns and even circadian rhythms.  This bidirectional relationship means that sleep disorders could disrupt the microbiome, but conversely, manipulating the microbiome may offer novel treatments for sleep conditions like obstructive sleep apnea and improve overall sleep quality.  This research opens up exciting possibilities for improving sleep hygiene through microbiome modulation.

At its annual developers conference ""Meta Connect,"" the social media giant's boss, Mark Zuckerberg, announced an array of devices in partnership with sunglasses brands Ray-Ban and Oakley. The firm also introduced a so-called neural wristband that pairs with its Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses to allow users to carry out tasks like sending messages with small hand gestures. The event comes as the Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp owner faces ongoing scrutiny over the impact of its products, particularly on children. He called the technology a ""huge scientific breakthrough"" before an audience of hundreds gathered on the company's Silicon Valley campus. The Meta Ray-Ban Display comes with a full-colour high-resolution screen in one lens where users can conduct video calls and see messages. It also features a 12-megapixel camera. Mr Zuckerberg hopes Meta's line of smart accessories will be a key platform for integrating its artificial intelligence tool, Meta AI, into people's lives. Analysts say smart glasses are likely to be more successful than the firm's multi-billion dollar Metaverse project - virtual worlds to connect users across digital environments.

The Display will be available this month and sell for $799 (£586), hundreds of dollars more than Meta's current smart glasses. Leo Gebbie of CCS Insight said he is sceptical that it will gain as much traction as Meta's other smart glass models. ""The Ray-Bans have done well because they're easy to use, inconspicuous and relatively affordable,"" Mr Gebbie said. Mr Zuckerberg also unveiled $499 Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses, which are aimed at sports enthusiasts, as well as the second generation of the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, priced at $379. Meta is currently in the middle of a massive spending spree as it bolsters its AI operations. Mr Zuckerberg said in July that the company would spend hundreds of billions of dollars on building sprawling AI data centres in the US. One of the sites is expected to cover an area that is nearly the size of Manhattan. That AI infrastructure investment is complemented by huge spending on hiring top talent away from rival companies. Meta has said it would develop what it called ""superintelligence,"" AI technology that can out-think human beings. Parents protest","Meta Unveils AI-Powered Smart Glasses and Neural Wristband

While it is thought the investments will generate thousands of jobs in the years ahead, the number of people on UK payrolls has fallen by an estimated 127,000 employees in the year to August, according to the Office for National Statistics. Meanwhile, Britain's life sciences sector has sustained a number of blows in recent days. US giant Merck rowed back on a plan to invest £1bn in the UK after blaming successive governments for undervaluing innovative medicines. Instead, it will move research to the US. AstraZeneca then paused plans to invest £200m at a Cambridge research site, a project expected to create 1,000 jobs. It has also switched investment to the US. Where is the investment going?","The UK government announced £150 billion in new US investment, a boost following recent setbacks in the life sciences sector.

In a rare acknowledgement of the seriousness of the situation affecting the landlocked country, Prime Minister Abdoulaye Maïga said the authorities were trying to improve security on the routes. The blockade - a potentially serious escalation of Mali's long-running jihadist insurgency - is particularly affecting the supply of fuel, which could cripple the country. The Sahel region of West Africa is known as the epicentre of global terrorism, accounting for more than 50% of all terrorism-related deaths. Several analysts say the aim of the al-Qaeda-linked militants is to impose a blockade of the capital, Bamako. When did it start? The blockade appears to have started with the kidnapping and subsequent release of six Senegalese lorry drivers along the Dakar-Bamako corridor in early September. This is not a new tactic by al-Qaeda's Sahel affiliate - Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) - but the scale is increasingly ambitious. They have imposed a blockade on two key locations: the Kayes region - which serves as the gateway for all food supplies entering from Senegal by road and train, and Nioro-du-Sahel - which sits on the main route linking Mali to Mauritania. Reports say Islamist fighters have erected checkpoints to restrict the flow of goods and extort ""taxes"" from traders. They are said to have torched fuel tankers, lorries and buses, abducted foreign drivers and attacked convoys carrying fuel imports from Senegal and Mauritania. Entire villages have reportedly been brought to economic standstill, with markets shuttered, transport halted and public services disrupted. Suspected JNIM militants have also ambushed fuel lorries from Ivory Coast in Bougouni, in Mali's southern Sikasso region. Several lorries were torched. ""Economic asphyxiation"" is the militants' goal, Mamadou Bodian of Senegal's Cheikh Anta Diop University told the BBC. He and others point to a strategic shift by the militants, who no longer rely solely on military confrontation to assert territorial control. Analysts fear that, if successfully implemented, the embargo announced by JNIM on Kayes and Nioro-du-Sahel could paralyse western Mali. So far, there is no shortage of fuel in Bamako, however prices have risen by about 10% in places and there has been an increase in the number of electricity cuts. What does the army say? The Malian army initially downplayed the blockade, with spokesman Col Souleymane Dembélé dismissing reports of a siege as an ""information war orchestrated by foreign media"". Footage circulating on social media of besieged vehicles on the Dakar-Bamako corridor had been taken out of context, he insisted. ''The video of the bus being set on fire dates from April and has no connection with the so-called blockade."" According to the army spokesman, ""no systemic interruption of transport has been observed"" in western Mali and the real challenge facing people in the Kayes region is ""the rainy season and not the actions of terrorist groups"". X Mali's military says social media videos of buses on fire are old Col Dembélé also characterised JNIM's increased activity as ""the last gasps of an enemy at bay and in retreat"". It is a refrain often used by Malian officials since the junta seized power five years ago. Last week, the army said it had conducted an airstrike on a JNIM camp in Mousafa, in Kayes, killing ""several dozen militants"" and destroying a site allegedly used for logistics and planning. Reinforcements were sent to Kayes and Nioro-du-Sahel, it said, with the military announcing ""hunting and destruction operations"" along major roads and a ""large-scale offensive"" on the Diéma-Nioro corridor. State media reported that hostages were freed during the operations, but did not say how many. Such efforts by the army do not appear to have lessened locals' fears nor the disruption to their lives. Residents report that militant checkpoints remain in place, while transport companies have suspended operations and lorry drivers continue to face intimidation. Why is this part of Mali so important? Kayes is said to account for approximately 80% of the country's gold production, and is also deemed Mali's ""gateway to Senegal"". It is a logistics hub where international trade routes converge. Mali is a landlocked country heavily dependent on neighbouring ports for fuel, food and manufactured goods, so control of Kayes is essential. The blockade not only disrupts local life, but directly threatens Bamako's economic stability. ""The Kayes region has become a major strategic target for JNIM, which considers it a vital space,"" says the Dakar-based Timbuktu Institute. ""The jihadists intend to disrupt the country's supplies, to destabilise, or even suffocate the Malian economy, isolate the capital Bamako and increase economic pressure on the Malian transitional regime,"" it says. The blockade also signals the geographic expansion of JNIM's insurgency. Traditionally, the group's operations have been concentrated in northern and central Mali - in Mopti, Segou and Timbuktu. However, JNIM has in recent years made significant inroads into southern Mali, including Sikasso and Koulikoro regions. By turning its attention to Kayes, the group is not only widening its footprint but threatening to encircle Bamako. What else is at stake? Since 2012, Mali has been in the grip of a profound security crisis fuelled by violence from groups affiliated with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS) organisation, as well as other armed militia. Local and international media warn that JNIM's recent isolation of parts of southern Mali could pave the way for similar incursions into neighbouring coastal countries. The crisis underscores the limits of Mali's reliance on military force, supported by Russian Africa Corps mercenaries, as the Wagner Group is now known, whose role in operations is not officially acknowledged. By disrupting trade routes from Senegal and Mauritania, JNIM has shown it can project influence westward, raising fears of an expansion into those countries. The Union of Senegalese Truckers (URS) blamed militants and described the recent abductions of lorry drivers as a threat to regional trade. Mali is Senegal's main African trade partner, accounting for more than $1.4bn (£1bn) in exports last year. The Bamako-Kayes route carries fuel, cement, foodstuffs and manufactured goods critical to both economies. There is a risk that what began as a tactical disruption may evolve into a prolonged siege, eroding confidence in Malian state institutions and exposing its fragility. JNIM's ""choice to target buses and tankers is not insignificant - it aims to strike at the heart of Mali's social and economic mobility"", Bamada.net reported last week. More than a local flare-up, the siege of Kayes is a warning sign that the jihadist insurgency in Mali has entered a new phase with the repercussions of economic sabotage reaching well beyond Mali's borders. More BBC stories on Mali: Getty Images/BBC","Islamist militants linked to al-Qaeda have imposed a blockade on key trade routes in western Mali, escalating the ongoing jihadist insurgency.  The blockade, centered around the strategically important Kayes region – a major gateway for goods from Senegal and a significant gold producer – has resulted in the burning of fuel tankers and other vehicles, the abduction of drivers, and the disruption of essential supplies.  While the Malian government initially downplayed the situation, describing reports as ""an information war,"" the blockade has caused fuel price hikes, power cuts, and economic hardship, particularly in Kayes and surrounding areas.  The militants, identified as Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), appear to be aiming for ""economic asphyxiation"" of Mali, potentially destabilizing the country and even threatening the capital, Bamako.  Analysts warn this marks a significant expansion of JNIM's activities, raising concerns about the spread of the insurgency into neighboring countries and highlighting the limitations of Mali's military response, despite recent airstrikes and deployments. The blockade underscores the fragility of Mali's economy and its dependence on trade routes with neighboring countries.

The Bank rate, which heavily influences borrowing costs and savings rates, was cut from 4.25% to 4% by the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at its last meeting in August. It took the rate down to its lowest level for more than two years, but many analysts believe there will be no further cuts during the rest of this year. The decision will be revealed at 12:00 BST and comes after official data on Wednesday showed prices were rising at nearly twice the target level, driven by the higher cost of food. The rate of inflation remained at 3.8% in August, well above the 2% target. The Bank rate is policymakers' main tool for controlling inflation. In theory, making borrowing more expensive means people have less money to spend, which slows prices rises. However, increasing borrowing costs can also harm the economy. Closely-watched vote The decision to cut the Bank rate in August was taken after an unprecedented second vote by the nine members of the MPC. Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank, said the decision to cut interest rates was ""finely balanced"". Analysts expect Thursday's vote to be more clear cut, with no change expected. The relatively high rate of inflation means policymakers are unlikely to risk pushing that higher by cutting the Bank rate. However, they do expect the inflation rate to start to drop soon, which leaves the possibility open of further interest rate cuts. The Bank rate has a big impact on the interest homeowners face when taking out a new fixed-rate mortgage. Lenders use the Bank rate to set their own rates. As a result, the expectation of interest rate rises can push up mortgage rates while the expectation of interest rate cuts can pull mortgage rates down. Mortgage rates have dropped very slightly since the MPC's last meeting in August, but further moves are uncertain, according to Rachel Springall, from the financial information service Moneyfacts. ""Many will be waiting with bated breath for the Budget. This waiting game, alongside forecasts for inflation to remain above target, makes it less likely for the Bank of England to make further rate cuts this year,"" she said. She said that savers had seen a downward trend in returns during the time when the Bank has been lowering the Bank rate. ""The average easy access [savings] rate has fallen further below 3%, so savers must act now and switch their variable rate account if it no longer pays a decent return on their hard-earned cash,"" she said. Global picture","The Bank of England is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at 4% on Thursday.  This follows an August cut from 4.25% to 4%, its lowest level in over two years.  While August's decision was closely contested, analysts anticipate a clearer vote this time, with no change expected.  This decision comes despite inflation remaining stubbornly high at 3.8%, significantly above the 2% target.  Although the Bank aims to curb inflation by increasing borrowing costs, the current high inflation rate and uncertain economic outlook make further cuts unlikely this year.  While mortgage rates have slightly decreased since August,  future movement remains uncertain, particularly given the upcoming budget and predictions of sustained inflation.  The continued high inflation and the need to encourage saving are contributing factors in the decision to hold rates.

Dartington Hall Trust is celebrating its centenary year with the release of ""All Things To All People"", a film featuring unseen restored footage from the 1930s and 1940s. It shows the Elmhirsts' mission to create a centre for education, agriculture and the arts. The Elmhirst family home has been also opened to the public for the first time and Peter Nicholson, the Trust's arts curator, said: ""The treasures that emerged were incredible."" Dartington Hall Trust Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst, who bought Dartington Hall in 1925, are photographed in the 1960s at the entrance to Dartington Hall's private garden The Trust hopes to highlight the project's role in influencing social and cultural change throughout the 20th Century. Mr Nicholson used old films from the archive to create the film, and said: ""It was pot luck. ""It was a bunch of rusty old film cans - you don't know what you are going to get. ""The labels had all deteriorated. It really was heart in mouth and hope. About 90 percent were OK."" The Trust's Film Unit had documented life on the estate in the 1930s, later filming heritage rural crafts like clog making and weaving, but during the war it made public information films. An extract from All Things to All People, a Dartington Centenary film Mr Nicholson said: ""The treasures that emerged were incredible. ""Dancing by the Jooss Ballet in the 30's on the lawn here on the estate and the restoration of the roof on the Great Hall are all captured on film."" In 1933, Kurt Jooss fled Germany when the Nazis asked him to dismiss any Jewish staff from his company but he refused. Finding refuge at Dartington Hall, he opened a dance school. Mr Nicholson added: ""They'd just got out of Essen with the Gestapo on their heels... ""Dorothy (Elmhirst) financed them to get them here and it's so joyous... ""The sense of freedom and joy at getting away from Nazism. You can see it in their faces on the film."" The films were originally silent but audio tapes were found from 1960s of Leonard Elmhirst describing what was on them. The centenary film edited the two together enabling the public to hear about the Dartington project from one of it's creators. Leonard Elmhirst's study has been reconstructed as part of the restored Elmhirst Heritage Centre The staircase within the Heritage Centre features a portrait of Dorothy Elmhirst and a cabinet with pottery by Bernard Leach, who set up a workshop at Dartington Hall It was Dorothy Elmhirst's vast American inheritance which paid for the purchase of Dartington Hall and its restoration in 1925. The family lived in the house with their children adjoining the Great Hall until the late 1960s but it had not been open to the public. Using photographs from the end of their time living there, the team found and restored the original furniture. The ground floor rooms including the Morning Room and Leonard's study have been reconstructed and the public can see them on guided tours. Dartington Hall Trust A portrait of Dorothy Elmhirst in ancestral Pilgrim dress by Walter Dean Goldbeck Upstairs is a gallery which includes 800 art works and 300 ceramics, to be shown in rotation. Mr Nicholson said: 'We've done this with a very small team on a very small budget... ""In the past the ideas needed big budgets and Dartington didn't have the money to realise it. ""Two years ago Dartington was in a difficult fiscal position but even at that point... I knew we could do this... With just a small team and we did it for a fraction of the cost.""","Dartington Hall Trust celebrates its centenary with the release of ""All Things to All People,"" a documentary featuring newly restored footage from the 1930s and 40s.  The film showcases the Elmhirsts' ambitious vision: transforming a neglected estate into a center for education, agriculture, and the arts.  The rediscovered footage, painstakingly restored from ""rusty old film cans,"" reveals the family's efforts and the vibrant community they fostered, including the refuge provided to Kurt Jooss's dance company fleeing Nazi Germany.  The film's release coincides with the opening of the Elmhirsts' family home to the public for the first time, showcasing meticulously restored interiors and a collection of 800 artworks and 300 ceramics.  The documentary, narrated using 1960s audio recordings of Leonard Elmhirst, offers a unique glimpse into Dartington's significant social and cultural impact throughout the 20th century.  ""All Things to All People"" is available on Blu-ray and DVD, with further centenary films to be shown at Dartington in September.

""It's kind of claustrophobic."" But a few yards down the same road in Milton Keynes, 25-year-old Charlotte Harris believes ""it is a really nice estate, it's full of families"". A report by the Open University has found people on new estates can have very different experiences of the same small area. For some the homes provide a ""safe and secure"" environment, but others can be left feeling isolated. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said its rules were clear: developments should include infrastructure. But the research says a lack of community facilities and public transport can create particular challenges for those on lower incomes, which can be ""unnoticed and unseen"" among the ""shininess"" of new homes. SAM READ/BBC Eagle Farm South has a play area, a local school and last year a convenience store opened on the estate Ms McCubbin, 31, lives with her husband and three-year-old daughter in Eagle Farm South, an area on the southern edge of Milton Keynes - beyond rows of large blue distribution warehouses. She grew up in the city, but most recently lived in Bristol until she moved back three years ago. She has been searching online for a new place to live. There are lots of children's parks but no ""accessible green space"" and ""if you want to go anywhere, you are going in a car"", she explains. ""There's not much soul or edge or community."" Milton Keynes is building houses twice as fast as the average for other areas in England, exceeding its government targets for new homes for the past seven years. Academics from the Open University, which is based in the city, worked with the charity Community Action: MK to visit three local estates. Interviews with residents informed the report: Hidden toil behind shiny fronts. SAM READ/BBC Dr Keetie Roelen is a senior research fellow in poverty and social protection at the Open University Lead researcher Dr Keetie Roelen said many people ""enjoy living in a new house in a place that is safe and secure"" but delays to infrastructure like public transport, shops and health services create ""challenges"". For those on low incomes, particularly without a car, this could ""create a lot of stress, cost a lot of time and add expense"", she said. Casey Carlisle,19, lives with his mum on the Glebe Farm estate. He described the area as ""really nice"" but he does not drive and the lack of a local shop means a 20-minute walk each way. ""If you've got a lot of shopping it's a trek getting back,"" he said. He is looking for a job and has found it ""quite tough...because you have got to think about travel"". SAM READ/BBC Mowale Jacobs says she enjoys living on the Whitehouse estate, particularly walking in the local area Another of the estates where the research was carried out was Whitehouse, which has a health centre, schools and a community hall. Mowale Jacobs, 38, is a project manager who moved to the area a year ago with her husband and two children. They previously lived in a flat in central Milton Keynes but wanted more space. The area is ""peaceful and serene"" she said, ""with a nice community"". She would like to see a bigger local shop. SAM READ/BBC The only shop on the Whitehouse estate sells groceries and convenience food Work started on Whitehouse in 2016 with the first shop opening in November 2024, but it is the size of a shipping container. Pushpinder Sethi, who lives on the estate, is proud of his shop which he described as ""cute"". But he is working with the local council and developers to open a bigger store. The research calls on local authorities to establish services and public transport links as soon as housing is developed. SAM READ/BBC Milton Keynes city councillor Shanika Mahendran says the authority has a ""good working relationship"" with many of the housing developers that work in the city Outside the health centre on the Whitehouse estate, Milton Keynes city councillor Shanika Mahendran insisted that her teams took an ""infrastructure first"" approach. ""We try and push developers to get infrastructure in beforehand,"" said the Labour politician, who is the council's cabinet member for planning. She pointed to a development called MK East where a school and medical centre were built before any residents moved in. The council has received more than £200m in developer contributions in the past seven years. ""The challenges exist in all places and actually new development and new growth really has helped us tackle a lot of these challenges from the large amount of developer contributions and income we have had. ""That allows us to put funding back into our infrastructure and back into services that local people really care about. ""Milton Keynes would be in a much worse place now without this level of growth."" ANT SADDINGTON/BBC Work on the Whitehouse estate began in 2016 but many more homes are still being built The National Federation of Builders, an industry body, said developers often needed to sell homes before they could afford to build local facilities. Head of policy Rico Wojtulewicz said: ""We need to not just blame the development industry, but we need to talk to local authorities [and] see if they are spending the money they have had for a decade off the developers as a contribution."" The group says its research in 2024 found local councils in England and Wales had £8bn in unspent developer contributions. ""I've seen loads of companies leave the housebuilding industry at the moment, because there is just no money in it,"" he added. ""That is bad because it means fewer homes."" He also believes more land needs to be allocated for employment, alongside housing, so the local services are in place. ""Good places need lots of land, not just houses."" SAM READ/BBC The Whitehouse estate will see 4,330 new homes built in total A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""We know how important it is for people to have the right services and community facilities where they live. That's why our planning rules are clear that developments should include infrastructure as we build 1.5 million homes through our Plan for Change.""

While some praise their ""safe and secure"" environments, others describe feelings of isolation and frustration due to inadequate infrastructure.  The study, based on 1,000 UK residents, highlights the ""unnoticed and unseen"" struggles faced by many, particularly those on lower incomes, lacking access to public transport and essential amenities.  While some estates boast schools and play areas, the lack of readily accessible shops and green spaces creates significant challenges, forcing reliance on cars.  Although Milton Keynes boasts rapid housing development, exceeding government targets, the report urges local authorities to prioritize infrastructure—including public transport and community facilities—concurrently with housing construction to avoid exacerbating inequalities.  Developers and local councils are both implicated; developers cite financial constraints in building amenities before selling homes, while councils face challenges managing developer contributions.  The report concludes with a call for better integration of infrastructure planning to ensure new developments create genuinely inclusive communities.

Over the course of the following two seasons, however, the show began to take some wilder leaps: Alex Levy (Aniston) became the nation's sweetheart after live-streaming a feverish broadcast of herself suffering from Covid. Another host, Bradley Jackson (Witherspoon), fresh from a surprise lesbian relationship, flew into space with a tech billionaire in a rocket. In a flashback in the same series, she also got caught up in the Capitol insurrection, filming the siege until she spotted her brother as one of the rioters. One character literally drove off a cliff at the end of series two – which felt like a statement on the show's whole refashioned narrative approach. Many baffled critics began to wonder what exactly the show was trying to be. In a piece towards the end of 2023's third series, The Guardian's Adrian Horton dubbed it ""the most ridiculous show on TV"", while Vulture branded the third series ""crazy"", adding that season two had taken ""sniffs of plot coke [cocaine]"". In a November 2023 piece, The New Yorker's Inkoo Kang described it as ""a uniquely destabilizing viewing experience"", but also wanted to know: ""Why can't we stop watching it?"" It's a good question. Rather than the ever-more outlandish plot lines turning people off, viewers stayed put, unable to peel their eyes off the action. Although Apple TV+ doesn't release viewing figures, in December 2023 it was revealed that The Morning Show had become its most watched series, with its viewership growing by 20% between seasons two and three. It certainly cemented its own unique appeal among fans who seemed to recognise it was all a little bit bonkers, but always came back for the next episode nevertheless. ""It's definitely a wild ride,"" says Rhiannon Evans, a UK-based entertainment journalist. ""I think what it does is it gets itself into some plot corners and incredible moral dilemmas that make you wonder: 'How on earth are they going to get out of this one?' And because it's a glossy show that doesn't really want you to hate any of its beautiful A-listers, it has to do some handbrake turns to get out of them.""","Apple TV+'s *The Morning Show*, initially praised for its nuanced #MeToo storyline and timely incorporation of real-world events, has become a ratings juggernaut despite increasingly bizarre plot twists.  While its first season resonated with audiences, subsequent seasons saw characters live-streaming COVID infections, flying to space, and even participating in the Capitol insurrection.  Critics labeled the show ""ridiculous"" and ""crazy,"" noting increasingly outlandish plots.  Yet, viewership grew by 20% between seasons two and three, making it Apple TV+'s most-watched series.

Israel says its aim is to free hostages held by Hamas and defeat up to 3,000 fighters in what it describes as the group's ""last stronghold"", but the offensive has drawn widespread international condemnation. The leaders of more than 20 major aid agencies, including Save the Children and Oxfam, warned that ""the inhumanity of the situation in Gaza is unconscionable"". It comes a day after a UN commission of inquiry concluded that Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza - an allegation the Israeli government strongly denied. Amid large-scale Israeli bombardment, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said al-Rantisi children's hospital in Gaza City was targeted in three separate Israeli attacks on Tuesday night, prompting around half its patients to leave. A source at the hospital said there were no injuries but that air conditioning units, water tanks and solar panels were severely damaged. ""This hospital is the only specialist facility for children with cancer, kidney failure, and other life-threatening conditions,"" said Fikr Shalltoot, Gaza director of the charity Medical Aid for Palestinians. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was looking into the reports. Reuters Tower blocks in and around Gaza City have been heavily targeted by Israeli forces in recent days The IDF announced on Wednesday morning that it had struck more than 150 targets across Gaza City in two days in support of its ground troops. As part of its operations, the IDF is also reportedly utilising old military vehicles loaded with explosives that have been modified to be controlled remotely. They are being driven to Hamas positions and detonated, according to Israeli media. Resident Nidal al-Sherbi told the BBC Arabic's Middle East Daily programme: ""Last night was extremely difficult, with continuous explosions and shelling that lasted from night until dawn."" ""Israeli vehicles advanced from Sheikh Radwan, Tal al-Hawa, and also from Shejaiya. It was a very, very frightening night."" For days - as Israel has ramped up strikes in and around the city - huge columns of Palestinians have streamed southwards in donkey carts, rickshaws, vehicles strapped high with belongings, and on foot. Until now, they have been forced to flee down the main coastal road to an Israel-designated ""humanitarian area"" in al-Mawasi. But on Wednesday, the IDF announced that it would temporarily open a second route for people to travel on - the central Salah al-Din road. It said the route would be open for 48 hours from 12:00 local time (10:00 BST). Many Palestinians say they are unable to move south due to the rising costs associated with the journey. Some say renting a small truck now costs the equivalent of £660 ($900), while a tent for five people sells for about £880 ($1,200). Aid groups, UN agencies and others say the ""humanitarian area"" they are expected to move to is heavily overcrowded and insufficient to support the roughly two million Palestinians who are expected to cram into it. Some who followed the military's orders to evacuate to the zone say they found no space to pitch their tents and so returned north. ""Everyday leaflets are thrown at us ordering evacuation, while the Israeli army shells buildings in every direction,"" Munir Azzam, who is in northern Gaza, told the BBC. ""But where can we go? We have no refuge in the South."" The IDF said on Tuesday that around 350,000 people had fled Gaza City, while the UN put the figure at 190,000 since August. Estimates suggest at least 650,000 remain. Gaza's health ministry said on Wednesday that 98 people had been killed and 385 injured by Israeli fire in the past 24 hours. Another four people had died from malnutrition, taking the total number of malnutrition-related deaths since a UN-backed body declared famine in Gaza City in late August to 154, it added. Meanwhile, families of the 48 remaining hostages held by Hamas - 20 of whom are believed to be alive - protested near Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's residence in Jerusalem on Tuesday and Wednesday, arguing that the offensive would endanger their loved ones. ""All day long, you boast about killing and destruction,"" said Macabit Mayer, aunt of hostages Gali and Ziv Berman. ""Bringing down buildings in Gaza - who are you bringing these buildings down on?"" Reuters Families have been forced to flee using carts to transport their belongings","Amidst a major Israeli offensive in Gaza City, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are fleeing their homes.  Israel claims its operation aims to rescue hostages held by Hamas and neutralize thousands of fighters, but the assault has drawn widespread international condemnation, including a UN inquiry concluding Israel committed genocide – a claim Israel vehemently denies.  At least 650,000 people remain in Gaza City, according to the UN, facing intensified shelling and airstrikes that have targeted civilian infrastructure, including the al-Rantisi children's hospital, damaging essential services but causing no reported injuries.  The IDF is investigating these reports and others of civilian casualties.  Israel has opened a temporary second evacuation route, but the designated “humanitarian area” is severely overcrowded, and many Palestinians cite exorbitant costs and lack of space as insurmountable barriers to relocation. The ongoing conflict has resulted in a rapidly escalating death toll, with Gaza's health ministry reporting 98 deaths and 385 injuries from Israeli fire in the past 24 hours, alongside 154 deaths due to malnutrition since a UN famine declaration in late August.  Meanwhile, families of hostages held by Hamas are protesting the Israeli offensive, fearing for their loved ones' safety.

After one of the most searing assassinations in US history, the governor of Utah pleaded for Americans to turn down the political temperature. But hardly anyone that I've spoken to since Charlie Kirk's death thinks that will be the path the country will choose. Not anytime soon, at least. Recent history is full of examples where America has chosen not to come together after a tragedy. It didn't happen 14 years ago after a Democratic congresswoman was shot in the head in Arizona. Nor eight years ago, when a Republican congressman was shot during baseball practice. Americans didn't even come together in the face of a global pandemic. In fact, Covid made divisions worse. OLIVIER TOURON/AFP via Getty Images Within days of Charlie Kirk's death, the country's political camps had already retreated to opposing narratives The reason is simple, yet hard to change. The incentives that fuel American political life reward the people and platforms that turn up the heat, not those who dial tensions down. Around the country, you're more likely to get elected to political office if you run on policies and rhetoric that appeal to your political base, rather than the political middle (it's the depressing byproduct of gerrymandering - the original sin behind America's dysfunctional, divided politics). Equally, in the media, people who opine about politics are rewarded for being more extreme and stoking outrage — that's the way to get more eyeballs and, ultimately, more advertising dollars. This incentive structure is what makes Utah Governor Spencer Cox something of an American exception. REUTERS/Cheney Orr Utah Governor Spencer Cox has tried to turn down the political temperature After Charlie Kirk was killed, he urged Americans to ""log off, turn off, touch grass, hug a family member, go out and do good in the community"". He sounded so sane, so wholesome - an effort, in a sea of division, at reconciliation. The 1960s and 70s versus today Division and political violence are not new phenomena in America. Some 160 years ago, the country went to war with itself and it has never really stopped. Over a period of five years in the 1960s, a US president was killed and then his brother was killed while campaigning to become president. In that same period, two of the nation's most prominent civil rights leaders were assassinated too. In the 1970s, President Gerald Ford was shot at on two separate occasions. In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan was struck by a bullet while walking to his limousine. Heritage Space/Heritage Images via Getty Images President John F Kennedy was shot during a visit to Dallas, Texas in November 1963 - the case still inspires conspiracy theories And of course, just last year Trump was the victim of a failed attempt on his life by a gunman in Pennsylvania — and a second alleged attempt by a gunman in Florida, whose trial began the week Kirk was killed. What makes this era so different from the 1960s and 70s, though, is what Governor Cox is worried about. While he has carefully steered away from saying things that would further divide Americans, he hasn't been so gentle with the social media companies that he clearly blames for this tragedy. ""I believe that social media has played a direct role in every single assassination and assassination attempt that we have seen over the last five, six years,"" Cox said in an interview on Sunday. He went on to say that ""cancer"" was likely too weak a word for what it has done to American society. Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images Trump was the victim of a failed attempt on his life by a gunman in Pennsylvania Most tech companies have stayed quiet in their official capacities. However, Elon Musk, billionaire boss of X, has weighed in, claiming that the ""radical left celebrated the cold-blooded murder of Charlie Kirk,"" and adding, ""unity is impossible with evil fanatics who celebrate murder"". He has also posted about the impact of social media, arguing: ""While at times the discussion on X can become negative, it's still good that there is a discussion happening."" 'This is like a bad marriage' The pitfalls of this system that blends social media with politics concerns even those who are the most passionate about politics, regardless of who they support. Earlier this week, Kaitlin Griffiths, a 19-year-old who is the president of Utah State University's chapter of Charlie Kirk's organisation, Turning Point USA, put it plainly: ""Social media is definitely a really difficult thing for our society. ""You can't even hold a conversation with somebody who doesn't agree with your political beliefs — and I just think that's honestly tragic."" Tragic and ironic, since Kirk saw himself as a champion of free speech, even as his critics often disagreed with that framing. His death though may push the country further from civil discourse. Kaitlin Griffiths: 'You can't even hold a conversation with somebody who doesn't agree with your political beliefs... that's honestly tragic' Within days of Kirk's death, the country's political camps had already retreated to opposing narratives. Many on the left are eager to explore the ways that Kirk's killer might have been radicalised by internet subcultures and group chats. Many on the right prefer to unpack whether the suspect was part of a left-wing conspiracy. Neither group seems particularly keen to prioritise reconciliation or healing. The reality is that those who study extremism believe that left-right may not even be the most helpful way to look at the division of this current moment. Samuel Corum/Getty Images Charlie Kirk and and his wife Erika pictured in January at the Turning Point USA Inaugural-Eve Ball in Washington DC ""It's better to look at what's causing people to be ungovernable,"" says Rachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who specialises in polarised democracies. ""It does take a desire to turn down the temperature… [and] requires people to have a little more courage than they're showing. ""I think it is more useful to focus on how we as a society turn a page and open a new chapter, because this is like a bad marriage. And like a bad marriage, you can only lose by pointing fingers."" What reconciliation would take As for the question of whether America can break the hold of the algorithms that stoke the divisions, that would take a leader of enormous strength with an equally enormous commitment to reconciliation. ""I'm not sure how we pull out of this,"" the politics writer David Drucker told me. ""It would help if both parties - and by parties I mean 'parties' not just political figures - agree to stop the recriminations and just say 'stop'."" ""Usually only a president can facilitate that. Absent both sides agreeing there are certain lines that shouldn't be crossed, or absent the next president doing so, I'm not sure how we get there."" SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images Trump has said: 'The radicals on the right oftentimes are radical because they don't want to see crime... The radicals on the left are the problem' Trump is not that type of president. He often seems at his strongest, politically, when he has an adversary to fight against. My understanding is that Trump does believe that people on the left want to destroy his Maga movement. And since Kirk's death, he has taken a very different tone from the governor of Utah. ""I'll tell you something that's going to get me in trouble, but I couldn't care less,"" he said, when asked how the nation can be fixed. ""The radicals on the right oftentimes are radical because they don't want to see crime... The radicals on the left are the problem."" And he went further in his Oval Office remarks following Kirk's killing: ""Radical left political violence has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives."" The framing by the president - that this was not just the deed of a twisted individual but of the radical left more broadly - is being echoed by other White House officials. ""With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have... to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks,"" said Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff. ""It will happen, and we will do it in Charlie's name."" However, a number of studies into politically-motivated killings and violence in the US - over several decades - suggest that more cases were carried out by people with ""right-wing"" ideologies than with ""left-wing"" ones, though more data is likely necessary to draw a firm conclusion. 'People say history repeats itself - it never has' Some people I've spoken to point to bleak times in US history as a source of comfort. ""Few periods in America have been more politically bleak or violent than the years [in the 1960s and early 1970s] shaped by Vietnam and Watergate,"" former Republican congressman, turned influential TV host, Joe Scarborough told me. ""But the country moved forward, celebrated its bicentennial, and moved beyond its violent divides. It will do so again."" CHARLY TRIBALLEAU/AFP via Getty Image This moment of tension feels like it rhymes with so many other periods of discord in American history - but it isn't quite repeating them Also among the optimists I spoke to was Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia, one of the country's most senior black officials. He condemned political violence as the most ""anti-democratic"" act, but also reminded me of the progress America has made on issues like race. ""The story of any family is always more complicated than the stories we tell ourselves at the family reunion,"" he told me. ""My father had to give up his seat [on a bus] while wearing his soldier's uniform to a teenager, but I now sit in a Senate seat."" Their hope is heartening - but I still don't see a clear path out. Lately, I've been thinking a lot about a conversation I had earlier this year with historian and filmmaker Ken Burns, as America prepares to celebrate the 250th anniversary of its founding. ""People say history repeats itself,"" Burns told me. ""It never has."" Burns instead prefers a quote that many have attributed to the writer Mark Twain: ""History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes."" In other words, even if the present looks like the past — things never happen the same way twice. This moment of tension feels like it rhymes with so many other periods of discord in American history, but it isn't quite repeating them. Yes, American history is full of anger and conflict — but I'm not sure this country's social and political systems were always so quick to reward the companies and people who stoke those emotions. Meanwhile the United States will get weaker, not greater. Former Defence Secretary Bob Gates once told me that the three greatest threats to America's national security were a rising China, a declining Russia and the country's own internal divisions. America's adversaries certainly know how much its divisions damage this superpower. They work hard online to drive people further apart. And Americans make it easy for them. Top picture credit: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images and Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images","Following the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, the US grapples with escalating political polarization and violence.  Utah Governor Spencer Cox urged Americans to de-escalate tensions, but many believe this is unlikely given the country's history of failing to unite after tragedies, including past attacks on politicians and the COVID-19 pandemic.  Experts attribute this persistent division to a system rewarding inflammatory rhetoric and outrage in both politics and media, fueled by gerrymandering and algorithms that amplify division on social media.  While some draw parallels to turbulent periods like the 1960s and 70s,  historians argue that the current situation, characterized by the rapid spread of misinformation and the incentivization of division, is unprecedented.  The debate centers on whether the root cause lies with left-wing or right-wing extremism, with little consensus on reconciliation.  Concerns grow that this internal strife weakens the US on the world stage, providing an advantage to adversaries actively exploiting these divisions.  The path forward remains uncertain, with calls for leadership capable of fostering unity and reforming social media's role in political discourse.

Wealden District Council will consider an application to create a battery energy storage system at Moor Hall Farm, in Ninfield. It would comprise 108 battery units arranged into 27 blocks of four, and other infrastructure, including transformers and a power station. But a number of people, including councillor Mark Fairweather, say the facility would harm the appearance of an area of ""unspoilt and remote countryside"". The units allow energy generated by renewable sources to be stored and released when they are needed most, according to the National Grid. Ninfield Parish Council and a small number of neighbouring residents have raised concerns around fire safety, highway safety and light pollution, the Local democracy Reporting Service says. Wealden District Council planning officers have acknowledged concerns and say the development would result in some ""localised landscape harm"", loss of high quality agricultural land and ""less than substantial harm"" to the setting of a nearby listed building. However, they also say these harms would be outweighed by the benefits of the facility. A council spokesperson said the development would contribute towards the UK's net zero target and increase the use and efficiency of renewable energy resources. They also said the project would create jobs, particularly during construction. Follow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

Work had already been ongoing to build a £2bn data centre in Loughton and open it by 2026. But now, Microsoft announced it would use some of a $30bn (£22bn) investment into UK technology to fund a supercomputer at the site. But what exactly is a supercomputer - and what could it power? What is the Loughton project? Getty Images Microsoft has thrown its weight behind the project in Loughton, a town in the south-west of Essex The Loughton site is due to become the UK's largest AI data centre, creating up to 250 permanent jobs when it opens in 2026. It is hoped the four-acre (1.6ha) facility will benefit services such as healthcare and defence. News that Microsoft is now backing the Loughton campus dramatically upscales what its output could be. Nscale pledged £2bn to create the centre, but it will now have a share of the £22bn pot brought by the tech giant. Nscale, Microsoft and NVIDIA, which will be building the AI chips for the centre, now say they can build what they have dubbed a supercomputer in Loughton. This will see thousands of devices working together 24/7 to form one large computing brain. What could it power? Getty Images The facility will contain 23,040 graphics processing units (GPUs) - or chips - to run the AI Nscale says the data centre will deliver 50MW of AI capacity, but is designed to grow. In the future, it could be upgraded to handle up to 90MW of power, nearly doubling its capacity. ""For perspective, even the world's fastest supercomputer in the US draws on the order of around 30 MW at peak, which is considered huge,"" says Dominic Davies, chief of AI legal-tech firm Lightbringer. ""So 90 MW is nearly three times that level, putting Loughton's facility in the global top tier for AI infrastructure."" These high-performance AI systems will train models like ChatGPT and power real-time services such as voice assistants. At the start, the facility will contain 23,040 graphics processing units (GPUs) built by NVIDIA. These are potent chips used to train and run AI models - the more GPUs, the more AI work the site can do. ""It will make the Essex supercomputer one of the most powerful AI computing centres ever built,"" says Mr Davies. What are the challenges? Do we have enough energy to power AI? Some people champion the idea of using AI for public services, arguing it improves efficiency by automating tasks and using data to make almost instant decisions. However, others say decisions made by the technology lack transparency and accountability. There are also logistical considerations. These AI centres need huge amounts of electricity, both to run the GPUs and keep them cool. Ensuring they do not overheat is essential to maintain performance and avoid damage. But that is tricky in a country where energy prices are higher than usual and there is pressure to use renewable sources. Google's greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 were 48% higher than in 2019, something it put down to the increasing levels of energy needed by its AI centres. Speaking to the BBC previously, AI expert Dr Haider Raza said ""awful"" electricity costs could also stunt growth. ""We have to make data centres more efficient. This point is very, very important,"" the University of Essex lecturer added. The government said it was ""exploring bold, clean energy solutions"" to meet its AI ambitions. AI facilities also need to be in places with strong internet connectivity so data transfer is efficient. There is also the challenge of making sure these sites, which often process sensitive data, have robust cybersecurity in place. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the UK was on its way to becoming a world leader in AI. ""Meaning more jobs and investment, more money in people's pockets, and transformed public services,"" he added.

This will create up to 250 permanent jobs and power AI applications such as ChatGPT and real-time services.  While the project promises significant economic benefits and advancements in AI, challenges remain, including the high energy consumption and associated environmental impact, the need for robust cybersecurity, and ensuring reliable high-speed internet access.

""No... Why would I do that?"" said the 82-year-old widow of the church's founder Moon Sun-myung, who had to be supported by assistants as she walked. Han Hak-ja flatly rejected claims that she directed the bribery when confronted by reporters as she emerged from nine hours of questioning at the prosecutor's office. The leader of the controversial Unification Church has denied allegations that her organisation bribed South Korea's former first lady with luxury gifts in exchange for business favours. Kim was indicated last month for various charges, including bribery and stock manipulation, which she denies. Her arrest marked the first time that both a former president and former first lady have been jailed in South Korea. Yoon was detained in January to face trial over a failed martial law bid last year that plunged the country into chaos. On Wednesday, Han pinned the blame on a former church official, saying the official acted on his own in offering Kim those gifts. The official has since been arrested. Her appearance comes after she refused the special prosecutor's summons thrice. ""I was in pain after [heart] surgery,"" she said. An ambulance was put on standby while she was being interrogated, Reuters reported citing the special prosecutor's office. On Wednesday, authorities arrested conservative lawmaker Kweon Seong-dong, who is also accused of receiving 100 million won in bribes from the church. Kweon, once seen as a close confidante of Yoon, denied the allegation. The Unification Church, known formally as The Family Federation for World Peace and Unification, was founded in South Korea in the 1950s by Moon Sun-myung, who proclaimed himself the messiah. The church is best known for holding mass weddings involving thousands of couples, some of whom would have only recently been matched by the church. Critics have described the group as ""cult -like"". Lawyers have accused it of coercing devotees, known colloquially as ""Moonies"" after its founder, to donate large sums of money. The Unification Church had come under the spotlight in Japan after the assassination of the country's former leader Shinzo Abe. The alleged assassin blamed the group for bankrupting his family and held a grievance against Abe for allegedly promoting it. The group is banned in parts of the world, including Singapore and more recently, Japan.","Han Hak-ja, the 82-year-old leader of the Unification Church, vehemently denied allegations of bribing South Korea's former first lady, Kim Keon-hee, with luxury gifts in exchange for favors.

Instead, Maher Haddad's 40 dunums (10 acres) are dry and empty, barely yielding a third of their usual harvest. ""This year was disastrous due to drought,"" said the 46-year-old farmer, reflecting on the land that cost him more to sow than it gave back. His fields delivered only 190kg (418 lbs) of wheat per dunum - far below the 400-500kg he relies on in a normal year. ""We haven't recovered what we spent on agriculture; we've lost money. I can't finance next year and I can't cover the cost of food and drink,"" Mr Haddad told the BBC. With two teenage daughters to feed, he is now borrowing money from relatives to survive. Mr Haddad's struggle is echoed across Syria, where the worst drought in 36 years has slashed wheat harvests by 40% and is pushing a country - where nearly 90% of the population already lives in poverty - to the brink of a wider food crisis. A report from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates Syria will face a wheat shortfall of 2.73m tonnes this year, the equivalent of annual dietary needs for 16.25 million people. Maher Haddad Farmer Maher Haddad said the drought had been disastrous for his crops Without more food aid or the ability to import wheat, Syria's hunger crisis is set to worsen dramatically, warned Piro Tomaso Perri, FAO's senior programme officer for Syria. ""Food insecurity could reach unprecedented levels by late 2025 into mid-2026,"" he said, noting that more than 14 million Syrians - six in 10 people - are already struggling to eat enough. Of those, 9.1 million face acute hunger, including 1.3 million in severe conditions, while 5.5 million risk sliding into crisis without urgent intervention. The same report showed rainfall has dropped by nearly 70%, crippling 75% of Syria's rain-fed farmland. ""This is the difference between families being able to stay in their communities or being forced to migrate,"" Mr Perri said. ""For urban households, it means rising bread prices. For rural families, it means the collapse of their livelihoods."" Farming families are already selling livestock to supplement lost incomes from wheat, reducing their number of daily meals, and there has been a rise in malnutrition rates among children and pregnant women. Yet, the implications of the drought stretch far beyond the thousands of kilometres of barren farmlands. Wheat is a staple crop in Syria. It is the main ingredient for bread and pasta - two food staples that should be low cost foods to families. So with the lack of wheat supply, the cost goes up. For 39-year-old widow Sanaa Mahamid, affording bread has become a massive struggle. With six children between the ages of nine and 20, she relies on the wages of two sons, but their salaries are not enough to cover the family's basic expenses. ""Sometimes we borrow money just to buy bread,"" she said. EPA Syria is relying more heavily on wheat imports, including shipments from Russia","Syria's worst drought in 36 years has triggered a devastating food crisis, pushing millions to the brink of starvation.  A 40% reduction in wheat harvests, coupled with a nearly 70% drop in rainfall, has crippled 75% of the country's rain-fed farmland.  The UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates a wheat shortfall of 2.73 million tonnes, enough to feed 16.25 million people annually.  This exacerbates existing food insecurity, with over 14 million Syrians (60%) already struggling to obtain sufficient food, and 9.1 million facing acute hunger.  The drought's impact extends beyond rural farmers, forcing families to sell livestock and drastically reducing food consumption, leading to rising malnutrition rates among children and pregnant women.  Soaring bread prices further burden urban families.  Without increased food aid and greater wheat imports, the FAO warns the situation will drastically worsen, potentially reaching unprecedented levels of food insecurity by mid-2026.

On 23 December, 1888, the day that Vincent van Gogh mutilated his ear and presented the severed portion to a sex worker, he was tended to by an unlikely soulmate: the postman Joseph Roulin. A rare figure of stability during Van Gogh's mentally turbulent two years in Arles, in the South of France, Roulin ensured that he received care in a psychiatric hospital, and visited him while he was there, writing to the artist's brother Theo to update him on his condition. He paid Van Gogh's rent while he was being cared for, and spent the entire day with him when he was discharged two weeks later. ""Roulin… has a silent gravity and a tenderness for me as an old soldier might have for a young one,"" Van Gogh wrote to Theo the following April, describing Roulin as ""such a good soul and so wise and so full of feeling"".

This is the first exhibition devoted to portraits of all five members of the Roulin family. It features more than 20 paintings by Van Gogh, alongside works by important influences on the Dutch artist, including 17th-Century Dutch masters Rembrandt and Frans Hals, and the French artist Paul Gauguin, who lived for two months with Van Gogh in Arles.","A new exhibition, ""Van Gogh: The Roulin Family Portraits,"" explores the crucial friendship between Vincent van Gogh and Arles postman Joseph Roulin.  Opening at the MFA Boston (March 30th) before moving to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam (October), the exhibition showcases over 20 of Van Gogh's portraits of the Roulin family.

In response, the US president hailed the special relationship between the US and the UK, saying the word ""special does not begin to do it justice"". The King's speech, at a lavish dinner for 160 guests in Windsor Castle, emphasised the deep connections between the two countries and the need to maintain cultural, trading and military links. ""Our people have fought and died together for the values we hold dear,"" said the King. The state visit will continue on Thursday, with Queen Camilla and the Princess of Wales attending events with First Lady Melania Trump. It will move from a royal spectacle to political talks and a news conference, as Trump travels to meet Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at his country house, Chequers. The president and first lady were greeted by the Prince and Princess of Wales The state banquet on Wednesday came at the end of a day of pageantry and politics, where the president was welcomed to Windsor by the King, Queen and a line-up of senior royals. When they arrived, President and Melania Trump stepped out of ornate carriages inside the castle's scenic quadrangle, before an inspection of troops on perfectly-prepared lawns. The Prince and Princess of Wales were also there to welcome the US visitors in this royal charm offensive, holding a ""warm and friendly"" private meeting with the Trumps. In his banquet speech, the president praised Prince William saying he would be an ""unbelievable success in the future"" and called Catherine ""radiant and so healthy and so beautiful"". Trump's historic second state visit showed a good relationship between the King and president, including some friendly moments as they watched the ceremonial parade. The King jokingly seemed to be warning the president to watch out for the sword of one of the soldiers on parade. PA Media President Trump was treated to a military showcase inside Windsor Castle Trump showed great interest when he was shown around St George's Chapel, saying: ""What a place, what a place."" Looking at the Royal Collection's historic documents about US independence, he commented: ""The real deal."" The president has been a long-time admirer of the late Queen Elizabeth and he laid a wreath and paid his respects at her tomb in Windsor. And official gifts were exchanged, including giving the visting president the flag that was flying over Buckingham Palace on the day of Trump's inauguration in January 2025. State visits are a form of soft power diplomacy, using royal hospitality to build relations with important international partners - with none more important than the US. That includes business links, with more heads of technology firms - such as Apple's Tim Cook and Sam Altman of artificial intelligence firm OpenAI - at the state banquet than celebrities. Alongside the state visit, £150bn of US investment into the UK was announced, including £22bn from Microsoft. PA Media The Princess of Wales, Queen Camilla and Melania Trump met in the grounds of Windsor Press baron Rupert Murdoch was at the banquet, sitting next to the prime minister's adviser Morgan McSweeney, at the dinner where guests were given a main course of Norfolk organic chicken.

The King and President Trump had a carriage ride into Windsor Castle The banquet concluded a day of events intended to make a positive impression on the president, in a shock-and-awe display of pageantry. With 1,300 service men and women from the Army, Royal Navy and RAF taking part, this was the largest ever guard of honour planned for a state visit to the UK. The much bigger than usual military line-up for the state visit was the UK government's message to encourage the US to maintain its commitment to Nato and support Ukraine. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer joined Trump to watch a flypast by the Red Arrows over Windsor, although a planned flypast by F-35 fighter jets was stopped by poor weather conditions.

""The idea for the need to tackle two existing problems in Ambikapur: plastic waste and hunger,"" Patel says. The idea was simple: to encourage low-income people, especially the homeless and ragpickers (those who collect rags and waste for a living), to collect plastic waste from streets and landfills, and give them hot meals in return. Rashmi Mondal is a local woman who brings plastic to the cafe. Every morning, she sets out early on the streets of Ambikapur in a search for discarded plastic – anything from old food wrappers to plastic bottles. For her, collecting such detritus is a means of survival. ""I've been doing this work for years,"" Mondal says, looking at the small pile of plastic she has gathered. Previously, Mondal used to sell the plastic she collected to local scrap dealers for just 10 Indian rupees (£0.09/$0.12) per kilogram – barely enough to survive on. ""But now, I can get food for my family in exchange for the plastic I collect. It makes all the difference in our lives."" Many people who arrive at the cafe come from underprivileged backgrounds, says Sharada Singh Patel, who has worked at the cafe since its inception.

On a rocky beach that glows red with lava, smoke-breathing dragons surround wretched-looking prisoners beseeching an angel to deliver them from suffering. The oil painting Death of the Dragon by Evelyn De Morgan looks at first like a scene from the New Testament's apocalyptic Book of Revelation.

But why should Trump give it? 2 hours ago Share Save Douglas Fraser Scotland Business and Economy Editor and Aimee Stanton Data journalist Share Save Getty Images The United States is the biggest export market for Scotch whisky. Donald Trump is back in the UK and in Scotland eyes are focused on what he might do about import taxes on Scotch whisky. The Scottish government is seeking a reduction or removal of the 10% tariff, which the whisky industry says costs businesses £4m per week. Scotland's national drink is a standout success story as a traded product. It is a form of liquid currency available in any country that allows alcohol - with its origins limited to one small country. Whisky has grown to become an important part of Scotland's and the UK's trade story. It is by far the biggest export in food and drink and it plays a clear role in Scotland's tourism offer. This week in particular, whisky stands as a challenge to Donald Trump and his US administration - will they make an exception for the product that represents the foreign nation which the US President holds dearest? Could this be the commodity, and could the state visit be the moment, to start dismantling the more damaging aspects of these current tariff wars? The looming threat of further trade taxation hangs over single malt whisky, which was subject to a 25% rate during Trump's first presidency. A deal struck to suspend that levy during Joe Biden's time in office is due to expire next summer. The Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) has called for the UK and US governments to agree a permanent settlement to ensure the higher rate is not reimposed, potentially on top of the current 10% tariff. Trump announced a 10% tariff on most UK goods earlier this year, as part of his efforts to boost US industries at the expense of international competitors. The 10% tariff is a base rate, and lower than the 15% tax on EU imports. The US is the biggest Scotch export market, with about a fifth of all exports heading stateside, and was worth almost £1bn in 2024, according to the SWA. Overall, whisky exports were worth £5.4bn last year, making it one of the country's most significant trading products. Across Scotland there are more than 150 whisky distilleries, which directly employ 14,000 Scots. And overall, 41,000 jobs are directly and indirectly supported by the industry, as well as over 25,000 across the rest of the UK. What's special about Scotch whisky? The case made by the industry is that it has to be uniquely Scottish and can't be substituted by any spirit made in the USA. Its character, they say, draws on £200m worth of American oak casks that each year are used to store maturing whisky. They add that American distillers are just as keen to see tariff barriers dismantled, so that they are free to export bourbon and tequila. The US tariffs have been a hard hit for the industry but other markets have even steeper rates. India's tariffs are among some of the highest in the world at 150%, while the Republic of Korea is 25%, according to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). However, whisky trading with India is expected to become easier after a free trade agreement was signed earlier this year. Domestic alcohol duty will also still apply. But not all countries have such high taxes on Scotland's national drink. Major markets like Australia, the EU and Singapore all have 0% tariffs when importing whisky from the UK. The data is correct as of 9th of September 2025 when the WTO's Tariff Tracker was last updated.","The Scotch whisky industry is urging the US to lift its 10% tariff on Scotch imports, citing a £4 million weekly loss for businesses.  With the US being the largest export market for Scotch, the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) is lobbying the White House for a permanent solution before a previously suspended 25% tariff potentially reinstates next summer.  The SWA argues that Scotch whisky is uniquely Scottish and irreplaceable, highlighting the industry's significant contribution to the Scottish and UK economies – employing over 41,000 people and generating nearly £5.4 billion in exports in 2024. While other countries impose higher tariffs, the US market is crucial, and the SWA hopes President Trump's recent visit to Scotland might lead to a resolution.  The current 10% tariff, while lower than the 15% EU rate, is still significantly impacting an industry reliant on American oak casks and facing increased domestic alcohol duty in the UK.

Lula has frequently criticised Trump, but this is the clearest signal yet that he thinks communication between him and his US counterpart is now broken. Even though the US has a trade surplus with Brazil, Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods in July, citing the trial on coup charges of Brazil's right-wing former president Jair Bolsonaro as a trigger. Lula described the tariffs as ""eminently political"" and said US consumers would be facing higher prices for Brazilian goods as a result. The tariffs imposed by Trump have hit Brazilian exports to the US, like coffee and beef, which Lula said would become more expensive: ""The American people will pay for the mistakes President Trump is incurring in his relationship with Brazil."" The two leaders have never spoken directly to each other. When pushed on why he had not just tried to pick up the phone or form a relationship, President Lula said: ""I never tried that call because he never wanted to have a conversation."" Trump has previously said that Lula can ""call him anytime."" But Lula insisted that members of the Trump Administration ""do not want to talk"". He told the BBC that he had found out about the US tariffs from Brazilian newspapers. Referring to Trump, he said that the US president ""didn't communicate in a civilised manner. He just published them [the tariffs] on his portal - on social media."" When asked how he would describe his relationship with his US counterpart he simply said: ""There's no relationship."" 'He's not emperor of the world!' Lula said that his poor relations with the US leader were the exception, listing how he had built relationships with former US presidents, UK prime ministers, the EU, China, Ukraine, Venezuela and ""all the countries in the world"". The Brazilian president attended the World War Two anniversary celebrations in Russia this year and has not cut ties with President Putin. Asked who he had a better relationship with - Trump or Putin - he defended his ties to the latter, saying they had formed them when they had both been presidents ""in previous times"". ""I don't have a relationship with Trump because when Trump was elected the first time, I wasn't president. His relationship is with Bolsonaro, not Brazil,"" Lula responded. He also said that if he passed Trump at next week's United Nations General assembly he would ""greet him because I am a civilised citizen"", but added that Trump may be ""president of the United States, [but] he's not emperor of the world!"". When approached for comment on Lula's criticism of Trump, a White House spokesperson referred the BBC to the US president's past public comments on Brazil. Lula said if the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot had happened in Brazil rather than in the US, Trump would have been put on trial Lula also spoke about his predecessor in office, Jair Bolsonaro, who was convicted last week. A 4-1 majority of justices on Brazil's Supreme Court found the ex-president guilty of plotting a coup after losing the election to Lula and sentenced him to 27 years in prison. Lula told the BBC that Bolsonaro and his co-conspirators had ""hurt the country, attempted a coup, and plotted my death"". Referring to the appeals Bolsonaro's lawyers said they would lodge, Lula said that he hoped that Bolsonaro would continue ""to present his defence"" but that ""for now he is guilty"". He also criticised Trump for ""inventing untruths"" by claiming Bolsonaro was being persecuted and denouncing what the US leader said was a lack of democracy in Brazil. Lula also told the BBC that if the 6 January 2021 Capitol riot had happened in Brazil rather than in the US, Trump would have been put on trial. In the wide-ranging BBC interview, he also advocated for reform of the United Nations. He criticised the fact that five countries - the permanent members of the UN Security Council - have the power to veto decisions and argued that this tilted the balance in favour of those who won World War Two, excluding nations representing billions of people like Brazil, Germany, India, Japan, as well as African countries. The result, he said, was that the UN didn't ""have the strength to solve conflicts"" and the five permanent members made ""unilateral"" decisions about going to war. Getty Images Lula travelled to Moscow for World War Two victory celebrations in May He defended his continued alliances with Russia and China – two nations where unfair elections and human rights abuses have been documented – while calling for a more ""democratic"" UN. Pressed on Brazil's continuing purchases of Russian oil while Russia wages war in Ukraine, he said Brazil was one of the first countries to condemn Russia's occupation of Ukraine and that ""Brazil doesn't finance Russia, we buy oil from Russia because we need to buy oil just like China, India, the UK or the US needs to buy oil"". He said that if the UN was ""functioning"" then neither the Ukraine war nor the Gaza war - which he described as ""not a war"" but a ""genocide"" - would have happened.","Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva told the BBC there is ""no relationship"" between himself and US President Donald Trump, despite Trump's claims of openness to communication.  Lula criticized Trump's imposition of 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, calling them ""eminently political"" and arguing they harm US consumers.  He attributed the lack of communication to Trump's unwillingness to engage, rejecting suggestions he should have initiated contact.  Lula contrasted this with his relationships with other world leaders, noting his continued ties with Russia, while simultaneously condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and calling for UN reform.  He further commented on the conviction of his predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, for coup plotting, criticizing Trump's defense of Bolsonaro and suggesting that similar actions in Brazil would have resulted in Trump's trial.  Lula stated that while he would greet Trump at the UN General Assembly, he does not consider him ""emperor of the world.""

Last September saw the first hatchling of the species at the Curraghs Wildlife Park for 18 years, with a further six hatching since. General manager Kathleen Graham said it meant the Ballaugh conservation facility was now home to ""the most flamingo chicks of any collection in the British Isles"". The species has been described as ""near threatened"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Keeper Karin The colony at the wildlife park now has 25 flamingos A spokesman for the park said keepers had built an extended beach area on the island within their enclosure, which the birds ""seemed to approve"" of and had begun to ""build volcano-shaped nests almost straight away"". They explained that raising the chicks in the first few weeks was ""very much the responsibility of the whole colony"" and said it had been ""lovely"" to see how the adults had gathered round to protect the little ones. With the population at the park reaching 25, staff were hopeful the ""current breeding success"" would continue as ""the larger the group, the more likely they are to breed"", he added. When the chicks hatch they have grey-white down and a straight beak. They develop their pink colour over a few years as they eat foods rich in the carotenoid pigments that make some plants, algae and crustaceans red, orange, pink and yellow. Keeper Karin Under human care flamingos can live for about 40 years Ms Graham said the team were unsure as to why there had been an influx of chicks. ""Sometimes you're left with more questions than answers as to why now,"" she added. She explained that it could be one of a number of reasons, such as global warming or changes in diet. ""But to suddenly have two chicks was amazing last year and to see five this year is phenomenal,"" she said. ""It has been an amazing turnaround for our Chilean flamingo colony, we're very pleased to see them doing so well."" ""And it's always nice to have babies, let's be honest.""

Seven chicks have hatched in the past 12 months, a significant increase following the first hatchling in 18 years last September.  This makes the park home to the largest flamingo chick population in the British Isles.  The park attributes the success to an expanded beach area in the flamingo enclosure, which encouraged nesting.  Keepers highlight the collaborative parenting within the colony, with adults protecting the chicks.  While the reasons for this sudden increase remain unclear – possibly linked to factors like climate change or dietary shifts – the park is hopeful this breeding success will continue with their now 25-strong flock.  The chicks, initially grey-white with black beaks and heads, will gradually develop their characteristic pink plumage over several years.

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood vowed to fight ""vexatious, last-minute claims"" after the deportation of an Eritrean man under the deal was temporarily blocked by the High Court this week. The man, who arrived in the UK by small boat last month, argued he was a victim of modern slavery in an appeal made just hours before his flight was due to take off. The Home Office is also reviewing the Modern Slavery Act to ensure it is not being misused. Mahmood said following the decision that ""last minute attempts to frustrate a removal are intolerable"". She added: ""Migrants suddenly deciding that they are a modern slave on the eve of their removal, having never made such a claim before, make a mockery of our laws and this country's generosity."" Home Office lawyers argued that the man could have claimed asylum in France. They added that delaying his departure could encourage others allocated to the return flights this week to make similar claims and would undermine the public interest in deterring deadly small boat crossings. In the first High Court challenge to the ""one in, one out"" scheme, the Eritrean man's lawyers argued he needed more time to present evidence that he may have been the victim of modern-day slavery - and that the decision to remove him had been rushed. The injunction raises questions about whether other migrants designated for deportation through the scheme could use similar grounds to delay or block their removal. A policy of deporting migrants to Rwanda put forward by the Conservatives under the last government became bogged down in repeated legal challenges before being cancelled by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer when he came into office. The deal with France was seen by the previous Home Secretary Yvette Cooper as one of her landmark policy achievements. It is now the job of her successor to make it work. Ministers agreed the ""one in, one out"" pilot deal with France in July to curb record small boat crossings this year. Under the deal, the UK will send asylum seekers who have crossed the Channel back to France, in exchange for those who apply and are approved to come to Britain. France has reportedly said it will only accept a small initial contingent of deportations, while the UK has said it hopes to increase numbers over the course of the scheme. The latest setback follows reports that the first flights to France left empty on Monday and Tuesday. Despite this, the first removals of migrants to France under the pilot scheme are still expected to go ahead this week.","The UK government will appeal a High Court ruling that blocked the deportation of an Eritrean migrant to France under a new ""one in, one out"" deal.  The man, who arrived by small boat, claimed modern slavery just hours before his scheduled flight, prompting the injunction.  Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood condemned the claim as ""vexatious"" and said it undermined efforts to deter dangerous Channel crossings.  The Home Office is reviewing the Modern Slavery Act to prevent misuse. While the government insists the deal with France will continue, the ruling casts doubt on its effectiveness, following reports of initially empty deportation flights. The deal, intended to curb small boat crossings, involves exchanging returned asylum seekers for those approved to come to the UK.  France's participation appears limited for now.

Sir Ed Davey said the company's decision to pause plans to invest £200m at the city's biomedical campus was ""deeply troubling"" and ""disastrous"", adding ""there is an American attack on Britain's pharmaceutical industry"". Tom Keith-Roach, the UK president of AstraZeneca, said Britain was ""an increasingly challenging place to bring forward innovation"" and announced the company would invest more into its US operations. The US Embassy has been contacted for comment. AstraZeneca's expansion would have created about 1,000 new jobs in Cambridge. Sir Ed told BBC East: ""The pharmaceutical industry has been one of Britain's leading industries and Cambridge and the East of England has been a key part feeding into that. ""This is a disastrous decision. We've seen from President Trump pressure [who] is saying, 'let's build up all the industry in the United States and charge higher prices for your goods elsewhere in the world'. ""There is an American attack on Britain's pharmaceutical industry."" The government said it was investing heavily in the pharmaceutical sector to make Britain ""the destination of choice"" . Getty Images AstraZeneca said it would be pausing its previously announced £200m investment in Cambridge's biomedical campus The Liberal Democrat leader said the government should be standing up to Trump and described the US president as ""no longer a reliable ally"". He called on ministers to make drug pricing part of the US/UK trade deal, which was still being finalised. ""The way you negotiate [with Trump] is to build up your own strength by showing you have alternatives. Let's rebuild our trading relationship with Europe, let's build our trading strength by trading with our commonwealth allies,"" Sir Ed added. Mr Keith-Roach told MPs on the Science, Innovation and Technology select committee on Monday that Britain pays far less than many other companies for its medicines and therefore it was challenging to bring new drugs to the UK market. Science minister Lord Patrick Vallance acknowledged that the NHS will have to pay more for medicines and agreed that the approval and regulatory process for new drugs needs to be sped up. A spokesperson for AstraZeneca said the company was ""constantly reassessing"" the investment needs of the firm. The government said it has committed up to £520m to the Life Sciences Innovative Manufacturing Fund. A spokesperson added that ministers remained ""confident in life sciences as a driver of both economic growth and better health outcomes, and our door remains open to future engagement"" with the pharmaceutical industry. AstraZeneca's global headquarters are at its ""discovery centre"" on Cambridge's biomedical campus Sir Ed was speaking ahead of his party conference in Bournemouth at the weekend, which will see the Lib Dems celebrate their success in this year's local elections. The Liberal Democrats now has a record number of MPs in the East of England, three of them in Cambridgeshire. It also runs a growing number of local councils including Cambridgeshire County Council and South Cambridgeshire District Council. Sir Ed claimed that there were now ""two big parties of change in British politics"". ""There is Nigel Farage and Reform who want to make Britain like Trump's America: very chaotic with people paying for their healthcare [and] the Liberal Democrats who are much truer to patriotic British values, where we want to reform the NHS so we get proper healthcare, reform the energy industry and tackle climate change,"" Sir Ed said. The Liberal Democrats will discuss a range of issues at their conference and there will be a session on how to counter the threat of Reform UK, the Liberal Democrat leader added.","AstraZeneca halts £200 million Cambridge investment, sparking political row.

AstraZeneca's UK president cited a challenging UK business environment.  The government, while acknowledging the need for faster drug approvals and potentially higher NHS drug prices, maintains its commitment to the life sciences sector.  Davey calls for the government to address drug pricing in the US-UK trade deal and strengthen Britain's trading relationships with Europe and the Commonwealth.

My last meat feast was seven years ago. My parents ­were visiting me in London from Costa Rica and we spent the evening going through the brief but rich menu of a small steak restaurant. For them, it was their final meal before returning home; for me, a farewell to my most carnivorous days. In the years since I've kept a diet of mostly vegetarian dishes, bits of seafood and the occasional exception. As this diet emerged from my work covering climate change, I pick and choose with that in mind: if an animal product is low carbon, like mussels, it will be on my plate regularly. Meat – a high-carbon food – features on my plate for special meals, like my mum's pork leg for Christmas, or on the rare occasion I really crave something like the Costa Rican pork belly-based specialty chifrijo. Each person has their own approach to climate-friendly food; mine is to reduce food-related emissions, not to have a perfect vegetarian scorecard. Since I moved to Scotland a few years ago, a new wrinkle has appeared: venison – the meat from deer. Deer populations are out of hand here: the Scottish Government estimates that the overall population could be around one million, up from half a million in 1990. Deer are thriving, partly because humans eradicated their predators, such as wolves and lynx centuries ago.","A shift towards climate-conscious eating is prompting some to reconsider meat consumption.  While a predominantly vegetarian diet is common for the author, who focuses on minimizing food-related emissions, exceptions are made for low-carbon options like mussels and occasional special meals.  In Scotland, where deer populations are high and culled, venison is presented as a low-carbon alternative, adding a new dimension to the author's approach to sustainable eating.  The author's personal journey reflects a growing awareness of the carbon footprint of food and the complexities of balancing personal preferences with environmental responsibility.

One of the earliest known depictions of entomophagy (insect eating) dates as far back as 30,000BC in the ancient cave paintings of Altamira in northern Spain, illustrating the gathering of bees. Today many people in Latin America, Asia and Africa consume insects regularly. In Mexico, for example, boiled and fried grasshoppers, ""chapulines"", are a popular bar snack and increasingly served in gourmet restaurants. But not everyone's biting. Though insects have long been considered inexpensive, healthy and sustainable sources of protein, they remain largely absent from American and European diets. In recent years, this reluctance has been exacerbated by a web of conspiracy theories claiming that ""global elites"" are forcing the public to abandon meat in favour of bugs. This disinformation obscures legitimate scientific research into insects as a source of climate-friendly protein and may hinder the shift towards more sustainable food systems, researchers warn. Popping up most commonly in the United States and pockets of Europe, ""I will not eat the bugs"" is a conspiracy theory that alleges that ""global elites"" will force the ordinary masses to eat bugs under the guise of environmentalism, says disinformation analyst Sara Aniano.","Insect protein, a healthy and sustainable food source with a history dating back millennia, is facing a backlash.

Iceland wasn't always the blockbuster travel destination it is today; in the early 1990s, the country saw just a little more than 130,000 visitors a year. By 2023, however that number had surged to 2.21 million, far outpacing Iceland's tiny population of around 380,000. Experts chalk it up to a mix of savvy marketing, social media virality and sheer natural spectacle. The 2014 #MyStopover campaign turned layovers into week-long adventures, flooding Instagram with images of steaming hot springs, glacier lagoons and volcanic black-sand beaches. Soon, Iceland was no longer just a niche destination for intrepid explorers; it was on every traveller's bucket list. But with soaring popularity came new challenges, pushing the country to grapple with the pressures of overtourism. Most visitors touch down in the capital city of Reykjavik and make a beeline for the Blue Lagoon or the well-trodden Golden Circle. But as Iceland's tourism boom shows no signs of slowing, the country is looking for ways to ease the strain on its most popular spots. The conversation around overtourism has become impossible to ignore, and one solution is clear: encouraging travellers to venture beyond the usual highlights. The country's north, with its dramatic fjords and geothermal hotspots, offers a quieter yet equally spectacular alternative to the capital, with idyllic towns like Akureyri and Húsavík providing a gateway to breathtaking landscapes without the crowds.

The small coastal town was once known for its whaling industry, and indeed Iceland is still one of only three countries that allows commercial whaling. However, many former whale hunting boats are now being converted to whale watching vessels in an effort to attract more visitors. ""I've been told there's a 97% chance of seeing a whale on any trip you take here,"" said BBC Travel Show presenter Roma Wells. ""Depending on what time of year you visit, you can see all sorts of different species."" That's because a variety of whales, including humpbacks, orcas and minkes, migrate through this area. In addition, many whale-watching vessels use electric rather than diesel engines, creating a quieter, more relaxing experience for both passengers and sealife.","Iceland's tourism boom, fueled by savvy marketing and social media, has transformed the nation from a niche destination to a global hotspot, attracting 2.21 million visitors in 2023—far surpassing its population of 380,000.

To alleviate this pressure, Iceland is promoting its less-visited regions, such as the north, highlighting towns like Akureyri and Húsavík.  Húsavík, Europe's whale watching capital, offers a sustainable alternative, transitioning from whaling to eco-friendly whale watching tours with a high sighting rate.  This shift aims to distribute tourism more evenly, preserving Iceland's natural beauty while benefiting local communities.

If you are buying a bottle of red, white or rosé then the specific year of the grape harvest is almost always written on the label. By contrast, non-vintage still wine - that made by blending two or more years - is seen as very downmarket, something cheap and not cheerful. And it is significantly rarer. Yet with climate change hitting vineyards around the world with more extreme weather, a small but growing number of quality-conscious wineries are releasing non-vintage bottles so they can make a more consistent wine. Chris Howell is the winemaker at Cain Vineyard and Winery in California's celebrated Napa Valley region, 50 miles (80km) northeast of San Francisco. He has been in the job since 1991, and he says that summers have got noticeably hotter. ""Weather is a complicated thing,"" he says. ""The issue people are focused on most in Napa are dramatic heat spells, heat waves that generally come throughout the summer, particularly in late summer. ""They have been around for as long as I have been here, but the peak temperatures of these are higher. The heat can be intense. You can get as high as 50C, something near to that."" Meg Smith Winemaker Chris Howell says there is still a stigma attached to non-vintage still wine With the higher temperatures comes the increased risk of wildfires. That was the case back in 2017, when he says ""tremendously intense fires"" broke out in Napa in the middle of the grape harvest. That year Mr Howell decided to only use grapes from Cain's vineyards that had been harvested before the fires started, approximately half of the total, to prevent the risk of the smell - and taste - of smoke in the air from tainting the subsequent wines. He says he is more ""relaxed"" than many winemakers would be about such a catastrophe, because he has long made a non-vintage red blend called Cain Cuvée. ""So some of the wine we were able to make in 2017 was held over to be blended with that from 2018."" Mr Howell adds that ""even without fires we are now subjected to more changeable vintages. So the odds are better if you use two different vintages to create the desired style for a particular wine."" Getty Images The Napa Valley wine region was hit by wild fires in 2017 While the world's still wines remain mostly vintage, there is one type of wine where non-vintage blends actually dominate – sparkling wine. This is led by France's champagnes, where the vast majority of those produced have always been non-vintage. Historically this was a necessity, as Champagne is the most northern wine region in France, and good summers were rare. So champagne-makers had little choice but to blend wines from different years to create a consistent, quality product. Yet thanks to climate change bringing warmer summers to northern France, there is now more vintage champagne being produced than ever before. Italian winery owner Riccardo Pasqua says it was enjoying the very best non-vintage champagnes that inspired him to make Italy's first multi-year still white wine. Located north of the city of Verona, in the winemaking region of Veneto, his family-run business Pasqua Vigneti e Cantine has been producing the non-vintage wine since 2019, blending it from as many as five different years. He explains that the idea was to produce the best possible wine from a single vineyard, removing the reality of vintage weather variations, both good and bad. ""I proposed it to my family and my board, and they told me 'you are crazy man, this is a big risk! You are going against the wine bible, the vintage is the vintage',"" he says. ""But I decided to stick to the plan, and we went forward. It is about getting the best expression of the vineyard. It is like a book, using more than one vintages gives the wine more chapters."" Pasqua's Hey French is made from a blend of wines from five years The resulting wine is called Hey French, You Could Have Made This But You Didn't. The unusual name is a jokey nod to Italy's ongoing wine rivalry with France. With climate change now hitting Italy's winemakers with everything from more droughts to bigger hailstorms, Mr Pasqua says that other wineries are now going down the non-vintage route, or at least considering it. ""I have to say in Italy already several wineries follow the idea. In Italy extreme weather events have gone from the extraordinary to the ordinary. ""Such as frost in April or early May, or hailstorms become more and more usual. Or heat waves with very high temperatures now year after year.""","Climate change is forcing winemakers to reconsider traditional practices.  Rising temperatures and increasingly erratic weather, including wildfires and droughts, are impacting harvests globally.  This has led a small but growing number of high-quality wineries to embrace non-vintage wines – blends from multiple years – a practice historically considered low-end.  California's Cain Vineyard & Winery, for example, blends consecutive years to mitigate the effects of extreme heat and wildfires.  Similarly, Italian winemaker Riccardo Pasqua created Italy's first multi-year still white wine, inspired by the consistent quality of non-vintage Champagne.  While non-vintage blends have always been common in Champagne due to the region's historically unpredictable climate, the practice is now gaining traction among quality producers facing the intensified challenges of climate change, offering a way to maintain consistent taste and quality despite increasingly volatile growing seasons.

The lawsuit filed Tuesday, and seen by the BBC, said faulty fuel switches caused the accident and accused the companies of doing ""nothing"" despite being aware of the risks of the aircraft's design. The families of four passengers who died on an Air India jet that crashed in June have filed a lawsuit in the US against planemaker Boeing and aircraft parts maker Honeywell, accusing the companies of negligence. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has said earlier that fuel control switches in Boeing aeroplanes are safe. The BBC has contacted Boeing and Honeywell for a response. The US plane manufacturer did not comment on the case. Instead it pointed to India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau's (AAIB) preliminary investigation report into the crash. The lawsuit alleges that both firms knew about the risk of a crash since they developed and marketed the 787 Dreamliner and its components. It cited a 2018 FAA advisory that urged - but did not mandate - operators to inspect the fuel switches' locking mechanism to ensure that it could not be accidentally moved, thereby cutting off fuel supply. In the case of Air India Flight 171, the switch was moved from ""run"" to the ""cut-off"" position, hampering the thrust of the plane, according to the AAIB's preliminary investigation report. The families said this amounted to a design ""defect"" that ""allowed for inadvertent cutoff of fuel supply and total loss of thrust necessary to propel"" the plane. They said: ""And what did Honeywell and Boeing do to prevent the inevitable catastrophe? Nothing."" The companies also failed to warn airlines that the switches required inspection and repair, and did not supply replacement parts to enable its customers to install them, according to the lawsuit. Boeing and Honeywell ""sat idly"" behind a gentle advisory that merely recommended inspecting the switches, said the families, who are represented by Texas-based Lanier Law Firm. A more detailed report of the crash is expected sometime in 2026. A total of 229 passengers, 12 cabin crew and 19 people on the ground perished when the plane crashed.","Families of four Air India Flight 171 victims have filed a lawsuit in the US against Boeing and Honeywell, alleging faulty fuel switches caused the June crash that killed 229 passengers, crew, and people on the ground.

The plaintiffs allege Boeing and Honeywell failed to adequately warn airlines or provide replacement parts, despite the risk.  While the FAA has declared Boeing's fuel control switches safe, the lawsuit contends the companies did nothing to prevent the catastrophe.  The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating, with a full report expected in 2026. Boeing has not yet commented on the lawsuit.

The biggest single investment comes from Microsoft, which has announced a $30bn (£22bn) spending package - its largest ever outside the US. It is part of a £31bn agreement, dubbed the ""Tech Prosperity Deal"", between the UK government and several US tech giants as part of President Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK. ""This is the week that I declare the UK will be an AI superpower,"" Mr Huang told BBC News. He said the UK had the expertise and research facilities to excel in AI, but ""what's missing is the AI infrastructure,"" adding: ""We are here to build it."" AI relies on large banks of servers, run on computer chips like those made by Nvidia, to operate. Nvidia is partnering with British infrastructure company Nscale to build more such data centres in the UK, and Mr Huang said he had aspirations of ""building an AI infrastructure company here in the UK, and then helping it scale out globally."" Meanwhile, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said he expected AI investment to drive UK growth and productivity. ""It may happen faster, so our hope is not 10 years but maybe five,"" he told the BBC. ""Whenever anyone gets excited about AI, I want to see it ultimately in the economic growth and the GDP growth."" Watch: UK is not giving up its digital sovereignty, Microsoft boss tells BBC The deal will see Google, Nvidia and others invest in British-based infrastructure including data centres as well as the creation of a new supercomputer in Essex. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the deal would create highly skilled jobs ""putting more money in people's pockets and ensuring this partnership benefits every corner of the United Kingdom"". Mr Nadella compared the economic benefits of the meteoric rise of AI with the impact of the personal computer when it became common in the workplace, about ten years after it first started scaling in the 1990s. But there are also growing mutterings that AI is a very lucrative bubble that is about to burst. Mr Nadella conceded that ""all tech things are about booms and busts and bubbles"" and warned that AI should not be ""over-hyped or under-hyped"". He acknowledged that its energy consumption remains ""very high"" but argued that its potential benefits, especially in the fields of healthcare, public services, and business productivity, were worthwhile. Meanwhile, when asked about the massive energy resources required to power AI, Mr Huang said solar power would contribute, and he was hoping for more gas turbines in the short term that could be put ""off the grid so we don't burden people on the grid"". He added that AI itself would design better gas turbines, solar panels, wind turbines and fusion energy to produce more cost-effective sustainable energy. The campaign group Foxglove has warned that the UK could end up ""footing the bill for the colossal amounts of power the giants need"". The supercomputer, to be built in Loughton, Essex, was already announced by the government in January, but Microsoft has now come on board to the project. Big tech comes to town Mr Nadella was speaking exclusively to BBC News as Donald Trump arrived in the UK on a three-day state visit. The Tech Prosperity Deal between the two countries seeks to strengthen ties on AI, quantum computing and nuclear power. Questions have been asked about what if anything the UK has agreed to give in return. Technology Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC the deal did not include guarantees over scrapping a tax for big tech or on copyright for AI companies. The Digital Services Tax - a 2% levy which raises about £800m a year mainly from US tech companies - was previously said to be part of trade discussions. But Ms Kendall told the Today programme ""that wasn't part of the partnership"" now agreed. She also said no guarantees were made to AI companies on copyright, a major issue for the UK's creative sector - which has expressed concerns its work is being used by AI companies without permission. Meanwhile, a number of other tech companies have pledged billions of pounds in investment alongside Microsoft and Nvidia. Google has promised £5bn for AI research and infrastructure over the next two years. Tech leaders including Nadella, Huang and OpenAI boss Sam Altman will accompany Trump to a state banquet hosted by the Royal Family at Windsor Castle on Wednesday evening. AI growth zone in north-east England The government also said there was ""potential for more than 5,000 jobs and billions in private investment"" in north-east England, which has been designated as a new ""AI growth zone"". It has announced a data centre project at Cobalt Park, Northumberland - dubbed Stargate UK - from OpenAI, Nvidia, Nscale and semiconductor company Arm. However the UK version is much smaller than OpenAI's US-based Stargate project, launched in January with a commitment to invest $500bn (£367bn) over the next four years building new AI infrastructure. The Tony Blair Institute described the news as a ""breakthrough moment"" but added Britain had some work to do. Dr Keegan McBride, an emerging tech and geopolitics expert at the institute, said that work included ""reforming planning rules, accelerating the delivery of clean energy projects, and building the necessary digital infrastructure"" for growth. The Conservative Party highlighted that other big international companies such as the pharmaceutical giant Merck have recently cancelled or delayed their UK expansion plans.","US tech giants have pledged tens of billions of pounds in investment to the UK, sparking claims the nation will become an ""AI superpower.""  A ""Tech Prosperity Deal"" totaling £31 billion, including Microsoft's largest-ever overseas investment of $30 billion (£22 billion), underpins this surge.  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang anticipates the UK's AI infrastructure will be built within years, fueled by partnerships like the one between Nvidia and Nscale for new data centers.  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella echoes this optimism, predicting significant economic growth driven by AI within five years, comparing its potential impact to that of the personal computer.  While acknowledging the energy demands and potential for market fluctuations, both executives highlight AI's benefits in healthcare and productivity.  However, concerns remain regarding the UK's energy costs and the lack of guarantees on digital services tax and AI copyright protection for its creative sector.  Further investments from Google (£5 billion over two years) and the creation of a new supercomputer in Essex contribute to this ambitious initiative, although some question the deal's terms and the long-term economic viability.  The government highlights potential job creation and investment, with projects such as the Stargate UK data center in Northumberland, but acknowledges challenges remain in areas like planning regulations and clean energy.

When you contract your muscles, such as during a bicep curl, that’s concentric exercise. When you lower a dumbbell back down, that’s eccentric – it’s when the active muscle is lengthening. Lengthen to strengthen You can do eccentric exercise in all sorts of ways, from yoga to using weights. For example in yoga, when you lower yourself into a position or pose, that’s a slow eccentric contraction. Even walking down stairs is a kind of eccentric exercise. Lowering a weight or running down a hill often feels like the easy bit. In fact, your muscles are working much harder than you think! And by focusing on these seemingly easier elements, you can harness remarkable benefits: increased muscle mass, flexibility, bone density and even more calories burned when at rest.","Eccentric exercises, the lengthening phase of muscle movement (like lowering a weight), are often overlooked but offer significant fitness benefits, according to fitness experts.  While concentric exercises (muscle shortening, like lifting a weight) are commonly emphasized, focusing on the eccentric phase – present in activities from yoga to stair descent – can increase muscle mass, flexibility, and bone density, and even boost resting calorie burn.  Experts highlight that despite feeling easier, eccentric movements actually engage muscles far more intensely than many realize.  Incorporating eccentric exercises into your routine can lead to substantial improvements in overall fitness.
","फ़िटनेस विशेषज्ञों के अनुसार, सनकी व्यायाम (Eccentric exercises), जो मांसपेशियों की गति के लम्बाई वाले चरण (जैसे, वज़न को नीचे करना) होते हैं, अक्सर अनदेखे रह जाते हैं, लेकिन इनसे महत्वपूर्ण फ़िटनेस लाभ मिलते हैं। जबकि संकेन्द्रित व्यायाम (Concentric exercises) (मांसपेशियों का सिकुड़ना, जैसे वज़न उठाना) पर आमतौर पर ज़ोर दिया जाता है, सनकी चरण पर ध्यान केंद्रित करना – जो योग से लेकर सीढ़ियों से उतरने जैसे कार्यों में मौजूद है – मांसपेशियों की वृद्धि, लचीलेपन, और हड्डियों के घनत्व को बढ़ा सकता है, और आराम करने पर कैलोरी बर्न को भी बढ़ावा दे सकता है। विशेषज्ञ इस बात पर प्रकाश डालते हैं कि आसान लगने के बावजूद, सनकी गतिविधियाँ वास्तव में मांसपेशियों को बहुत अधिक तीव्रता से संलग्न करती हैं जितना कई लोग समझते हैं। अपने नियमित व्यायाम में सनकी व्यायाम को शामिल करने से समग्र फ़िटनेस में पर्याप्त सुधार हो सकता है।

Abu Agila Mas'ud Kheir Al-Marimi, 74, has said he was in custody in Libya when three masked men ordered him to memorise information about the destruction of Pan Am 103 and another terror attack. Referred to as Mas'ud by prosecutors, he said he repeated what he had learned to a Libyan official, under duress, after the men threatened his family. Masud's lawyers have asked a federal court in Washington to rule the alleged confession inadmissible in advance of his trial in April next year. Details of the alleged confession were first made public five years ago after the US department of justice announced it was charging Mas'ud over the atrocity which claimed the lives of 270 people on 21 December 1988. A criminal complaint summary compiled by the FBI claimed he had admitted playing a key role in the attack when he was in detention in 2012, following the collapse of Colonel Gaddafi's regime the previous year. The bureau said Mas'ud had talked of being involved in the plot along with other members of the Libyan intelligence service. Afterwards, he was said to have been congratulated in person by the Libyan dictator, who had told him he had performed ""a great national duty"" against the Americans. Reuters Abu Agila Mas'ud Kheir Al-Marimi has been in custody since December 2022 Of the 259 passengers and crew who died on board the airliner, 190 were from the United States, where the Mas'ud case will be tried. The only Lockerbie trial so far took place between May 2000 and January 2001, when three Scottish judges convicted Libyan intelligence agent Abdulbasset al-Megrahi of playing a key role in the plot. Megrahi was jailed for life but released on compassionate grounds by the Scottish government in 2009 after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer. He died three years later at home in Tripoli. With just seven months to go until the scheduled start of Mas'ud's trial, public defenders acting on his behalf have lodged a motion with the district court asking a judge to rule that his confession should not be allowed as evidence. The Libyan has pled not guilty to the charges against him. But the ""motion to suppress"" reveals for the first time his version of what led to the alleged jailhouse confession. Setting the scene, the motion quotes a US Department of State report which said Gaddafi's regime had controlled Libya through extrajudicial killings and intimidation, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention. The document says that after the revolution there was a climate of anger and retaliation against those associated or thought to be associated with Gaddafi. Contemporary reports by US government officials recount more incidents of ""arbitrary and unlawful killings, kidnappings, torture and other cruel and inhuman or degrading treatment."" The defence lawyers say: ""Just as... a black man accused of killing a white man in Jim Crow-era Arkansas would fear mob violence... so would a Libyan who allegedly worked for Gaddafi have feared retaliation against himself and his family in post-revolution Libya."" It was against that background, according to Mas'ud, that he was abducted from his home by armed men, separated from his family and his medication, held incommunicado in an unofficial prison facility and denied procedural rights. He says he saw bodies lying in the streets when he was being driven to the prison and while in custody, and encountered other inmates who had been beaten and abused. Mas'ud has told his legal team that he was alone in a small room when three men in civilian clothes came in. They were unarmed but wearing face coverings and did not identify themselves. He says he was certain the men, who handed him the piece of paper, were anti-Gadaffi revolutionaries. ""The single, handwritten sheet began with an order that Mr Al-Marimi confess to the Lockerbie incident, as well as another terrorist attack,"" his defence lawyers claim. The men told him to read over the details and to repeat what it said when he was questioned by someone else the next day. ""They told him he had to answer the questions with what was on the paper, otherwise bad things would happen to him or his family. ""Mr Al-Marimi felt he had no choice but to comply. He had ample reason to fear for himself; before his seizure, he had personally witnessed beatings in others prisons. ""But he was more afraid for his family. He had six children and felt they still had lives left to live. If he resisted, his children could be assaulted or killed. He personally knew about a friend's daughter who had been shot before his abduction."" AFP via Getty Images Abdelbaset Ali Mohamed al-Megrahi is the only person to have been convicted in connection with the Lockerbie bombing","Abu Agila Mas'ud Kheir Al-Marimi, 74, a Libyan man accused of involvement in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, claims his confession was coerced.  His lawyers filed a motion in a New York federal court to suppress the confession, arguing it was obtained under duress following his arrest in December 2022.  Mas'ud alleges that after the fall of Gaddafi's regime, anti-Gaddafi revolutionaries forced him to memorize and repeat a false confession detailing his role in the bombing and another attack.  He feared for his family's safety if he refused.  The confession, first revealed five years ago, was cited in the US Department of Justice's charges against Mas'ud, who pleads not guilty.  His trial is scheduled for April 2024.  The Lockerbie bombing killed 270 people, including 190 Americans.  The only previous conviction was that of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, who was later released on compassionate grounds due to illness and died in 2012.  Mas'ud's defense cites a climate of violence and retribution following the Gaddafi regime's collapse as justification for his claims of coercion.

Their lawyer says the French president and Mrs Macron will present the documentation in a defamation suit they have taken against the right-wing influencer Candace Owens after she promoted her belief that Brigitte Macron was born male. Ms Owens' lawyers have responded with a motion to dismiss the claim. Speaking to the BBC's Fame Under Fire podcast, the Macrons' lawyer in the case, Tom Clare, said Mrs Macron had found the claims ""incredibly upsetting"" and they were a ""distraction"" to the French president. ""I don't want to suggest that it somehow has thrown him off his game. But just like anybody who is juggling a career and a family life as well, when your family is under attack, it wears on you. And he's not immune from that because he's the president of a country,"" he said. Mr Clare said there would be ""expert testimony that will come out that will be scientific in nature"" and while he would not reveal, at this stage, its exact nature, he said the couple were prepared to demonstrate fully ""both generically and specifically"" that the allegations are false. ""It is incredibly upsetting to think that you have to go and subject yourself, to put this type of proof forward,"" he said. ""It is a process that she will have to subject herself to in a very public way. But she's willing to do it. She is firmly resolved to do what it takes to set the record straight. ""If that unpleasantness and that discomfort that she has of opening herself up in that way is what it takes to set a record straight and stop this, she's 100% ready to meet that burden."" The Macrons' lawyer Tom Clare says the couple find the allegations upsetting and can demonstrate they are false When asked if the Macrons would be supplying pictures of Brigitte pregnant and raising her children, Mr Clare said they existed and would be presented in court where there are rules and standards. Ms Owens, a former commentator for conservative US outlet Daily Wire who has millions of followers on social media, has repeatedly promoted her view that Brigitte Macron is a man. In March 2024, she claimed she would stake her ""entire professional reputation"" on the allegation. The allegation originated in fringe online spaces years earlier, notably through a 2021 YouTube video by French bloggers Amandine Roy and Natacha Rey. The Macrons initially won a defamation case in France against Roy and Rey in 2024, but that ruling was overturned on appeal in 2025 on freedom of expression grounds, not on the basis of truth. The Macrons are appealing the decision. In July, the Macrons filed a lawsuit against Ms Owens in the US. It alleges she ""disregarded all credible evidence disproving her claim in favour of platforming known conspiracy theorists and proven defamers"". In American defamation cases against public figures, plaintiffs are required to prove ""actual malice"" - that the defendant knowingly spread false information or acted with reckless disregard for the truth.

While Owens' lawyers have filed a motion to dismiss, the Macrons' lawyer stated they are prepared to demonstrate the falsity of the allegations ""both generically and specifically,"" including via expert testimony.  This legal action follows a previous French court case against other individuals who made similar claims, a ruling which was overturned on appeal.

""While people celebrated a baptism ceremony, gunmen opened fire, sowing death and terror,"" local civil rights activist Maikoul Zodi said on social media. A resident told the French news agency AFP that 15 people were killed at the ceremony in Tillabéri region, which borders Mali and Burkina Faso, before moving elsewhere and killing seven others. Gunmen on motorbikes have shot dead 22 people, most of them attending a baptism ceremony, in an attack on a village in western Niger, reports say. The AFP news agency also cited local media outlet Elmaestro TV as reporting a ""gruesome death toll of 22 innocent people cowardly killed without reason or justification"". Niger's authorities have confirmed there was an attack in the area but have not given any casualty figures. Last week, Human Rights Watch said jihadist groups had increased attacks in the country since March, summarily killing over 127 villagers and Muslim worshippers. Dozens of homes have been looted and burned over the same period, it said. The group blamed authorities for not adequately responding to warnings of attacks and ignoring calls for help by villagers. Last Wednesday, 14 Nigerien soldiers were killed in an ambush in the Tillabéri region, a figure that the army announced in its weekly bulletin on Saturday. The army said one of its units was deployed following reports of a cattle theft by armed men, but the operation turned out to be ""an ambush"". It is often difficult to independently verify the real numbers of casualties in such attacks due to access restrictions and the fear of reprisals among witnesses and local media. On Tuesday, Mr Zodi questioned why civilians were still being exposed to such insecurity, and urged the government to prioritise the safety and dignity of citizens. ""It is time for concrete answers, strengthen state presence in vulnerable areas, and show that every Nigerien life matters,"" he posted on Facebook. Niger has been under military control since 2023 when Gen Abdourahmane Tchiani deposed the country's elected President, Mohamed Bazoum. Its neighbours Burkina Faso and Mali, battling the same jihadist insurgency, are also ruled by military leaders but have similarly struggled to contain the problem. The three have expelled French and US forces that were previously heavily involved in the fight against jihadists that operate across the Sahel region. Besides scaling back their ties with the West, they have since formed an alliance to fight the jihadist threat, turning to Russia and Turkey for their security needs. However, the violence has continued. Additional reporting by Mariama Soumana in Niamey","At least 22 people, mostly attending a baptism ceremony, were killed in a jihadist attack in Niger's Tillabéri region, bordering Mali and Burkina Faso.  Gunmen on motorbikes opened fire during the ceremony, then continued their assault elsewhere, resulting in a higher death toll than initially reported.  While Niger's military government confirmed the attack as terrorist-related, it hasn't released official casualty figures.  This attack follows a pattern of escalating violence in the region since March, with Human Rights Watch reporting over 127 villagers killed and dozens of homes looted and burned, blaming authorities for inadequate response to warnings.  The increased attacks coincide with Niger's military coup in 2023 and the subsequent expulsion of French and U.S. forces, despite the formation of a regional alliance to combat jihadist groups.  The ongoing insecurity has prompted concerns from civil rights activists demanding increased government protection for civilians.  The perpetrators remain at large.

If you've ever watched or read Shakespeare's late 16th-Century play The Taming of the Shrew, you'll be familiar with the antiquated gender tropes at play. The famous story centres on protagonist Petruchio, who exacts various punishments on his headstrong wife Katherine to transform her into an ""ideal"" pliant and submissive woman. But modern audiences may be less aware of the diagnosis for Katherine's intolerable wilfulness: an excess of yellow bile (known as ""choler"") rushing in her blood, leading to a stubborn and hot-headed disposition. Yet more bizarrely, treating the affliction involves Petruchio preventing Katherine from eating ""hot"" foods that might further inflame her condition. Beef served with mustard, for instance, is strictly off limits. While baffling to an audience today, humoral theory, which these ideas stemmed from, was a hugely popular framework for understanding health and personality in Shakespeare's time – and for millennia before him.","Shakespeare's *The Taming of the Shrew* offers a glimpse into ancient humoral theory, a now-obsolete system of personality classification.  Katherine's ""intolerable wilfulness"" is attributed to an excess of yellow bile (""choler""), causing her hotheadedness.  Petruchio's ""taming"" methods, including dietary restrictions (avoiding ""hot"" foods like beef with mustard), reflect the era's belief in humoral imbalances affecting temperament.  While archaic, the play showcases the enduring influence of this ancient Greek medical framework on perceptions of personality and behavior.

The fires burned across more than 11,000 hectares (27,000 acres) at Carrbridge and Dava in the north of Scotland in late June and early July. Colin McClean, land manager of the Cairngorms National Park Authority, told BBC Scotland's Landward programme the fire would have a lasting impact on the environment. Curlew and grouse chicks would have been among the birds unable to escape the flames, while hares would also have fallen victim to the blaze. Mr McClean was one of the many people drafted in to try to help tackle the fires. ""I've helped in a lot of wildfires in the past - but I've never seen anything on this scale,"" he recalled. ""It was quite scary really, the power and ferocity of a fire of this size. ""This is the biggest wildfire that has been recorded in living memory in Scotland."" The aftermath of the wildfire at Dava There were reports of smoke from the wildfire near Carrbridge drifting for 40 miles (64km) across the Moray Firth. Residents in Orkney also reported smelling smoke carried miles north on the wind, while the sky in parts of the country were tinged orange at dawn and dusk. Meanwhile in the immediate vicinity of the fire, roads were closed and people were told to keep windows of homes and businesses closed due to smoke. The wildfires burned for days in June and July Now the impact of the fires can still be seen for miles around from height, but it can also be seen up close too. Small piles of bones starkly show the impact on wildlife, as well as on the ground itself. One particular collection of bones he described as probably being that of a leveret (a young hare). ""It probably sat tight for too long, because that's their instinct to do that when danger comes,"" he said. Animal bones were found in the aftermath of the fires ""They just sit in front of the flames unfortunately and perish. ""That must have happened to thousands of animals in a fire of this scale."" Hares would have not been the only victims. ""As a result of this fire we'll have lost curlews, black grouse, red grouse, all those chicks will have gone,"" Mr McClean said. He explained that a wide range of plant species were also affected. Colin McClean described the power of the fires as ""scary"" Two months later, grass is coming back through the charred ground, and heather is also expected to recover relatively quickly. In some areas the fire swept through swiftly. However, in the other parts, the fire penetrated deeper, burning away peat which would have formed thousands of years ago. Ben Clinch said hundreds of hectares of Scots pine were lost to the fires Moorland was not the only casualty. Ben Clinch is a woodlands manager on a Moray estate, who witnessed the flames approaching first hand. ""Two fires converged, it was just like a biblical scene, the fire jumped over the road,"" he said. He estimates about 200 hectares (500 acres) of Scots pine was lost there alone. Many of the trees - a natural habitat for wildlife - are blackened or have fallen over. The hope is enough trees have survived to be able to shed seed on the area and then regenerate. What causes wildfires? Peter Jolly Fires broke out in the Dava area in June The fire service classifies wildfires as large and uncontrolled outdoor fires exceeding 1,000 sq m of burned area. These fires are unplanned and unpredictable. They happen in areas with combustible vegetation that can fuel rapid spread. Human activity is often to blame, with the fires being started by barbecues, glass bottles magnifying sunlight on dry vegetation, or discarded cigarettes. One of the reasons fires continue to burn on moorland is because of peaty soil which fuels the flames. A helicopter was used to waterbomb pockets of the fire","Devastating wildfires in the Scottish Highlands, described as the worst in living memory, have scorched over 11,000 hectares (27,000 acres) in the Carrbridge and Dava areas.  The June and July blazes, fueled by drought and peat, are feared to have killed thousands of animals, including curlews, grouse, and hares.  Witnesses described scenes of biblical proportions, with two fires converging and flames jumping roads.  The smoke drifted for miles, causing orange skies and prompting road closures.  While some vegetation is showing signs of recovery, significant damage remains, including the loss of hundreds of hectares of Scots pine and the destruction of peatlands formed over millennia.  The cause of the fires is still under investigation, but human activity is suspected.  The scale of the wildlife loss is particularly concerning, with charred animal remains discovered in the aftermath.

In 1999, Munsch was made a member of the Order of Canada. A decade later, he received a star of Canada's Walk of Fame in Toronto. In the interview with the New York Times Magazine, Munsch said his decision was influenced by watching his brother die from Lou Gehrig's disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - the most common form of motor neurone disease (MND). Munsch said: ""They kept him alive through all these interventions. I thought, let him die."" In Canada, people over 18 must meet several requirements to be eligible for assisted dying. They include having a ""serious and incurable illness"", making a ""voluntary request that is not the result of external pressure"" and be in an ""advanced state of irreversible decline in capability"". Two independent doctors or nurse practitioners must then assess the patient to confirm that all of the eligibility requirements are met. Scholastic, Munsch's publisher, said in a statement on Instagram that his decision to speak publicly about medically assisted dying ""reminds us, once again, why Robert's work continues to touch many generations"". Munsch's daugher, Julie, posted on Facebook that her father's decision to pursue medically assisted dying was made five years ago. Julie called the New York Times Magazine interview ""great"", but added that ""nowhere does it say my dad isn't doing well, nor that he's going to die anytime soon"". According to Canadian law, the person must be able to actively consent on the day of his death. ""I have to pick the moment when I can still ask for it,"" he said in the interview. Medically assisted dying accounted for 4.7% of deaths in Canada in 2023 - the most recent official government statistics. Some 96% of the 15,300 people that underwent assisted dying in 2023 had a death deemed ""reasonably forseeable"", due to severe medical conditions like cancer.","Celebrated Canadian children's author Robert Munsch, 80, has been approved for medically assisted dying in Canada.

The biggest single investment comes from Microsoft, which has announced a $30bn (£22bn) spending package - its largest ever outside the US. It is part of a £31bn agreement, dubbed the ""Tech Prosperity Deal"", between the UK government and several US tech giants as part of President Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK. ""This is the week that I declare the UK will be an AI superpower,"" Mr Huang told BBC News. He said the UK had the expertise and research facilities to excel in AI, but ""what's missing is the AI infrastructure,"" adding: ""We are here to build it."" AI relies on large banks of servers, run on computer chips like those made by Nvidia, to operate. Nvidia is partnering with British infrastructure company Nscale to build more such data centres in the UK, and Mr Huang said he had aspirations of ""building an AI infrastructure company here in the UK, and then helping it scale out globally."" Meanwhile, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said he expected AI investment to drive UK growth and productivity. ""It may happen faster, so our hope is not 10 years but maybe five,"" he told the BBC. ""Whenever anyone gets excited about AI, I want to see it ultimately in the economic growth and the GDP growth."" Watch: UK is not giving up its digital sovereignty, Microsoft boss tells BBC The deal will see Google, Nvidia and others invest in British-based infrastructure including data centres as well as the creation of a new supercomputer in Essex. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the deal would create highly skilled jobs ""putting more money in people's pockets and ensuring this partnership benefits every corner of the United Kingdom"". Mr Nadella compared the economic benefits of the meteoric rise of AI with the impact of the personal computer when it became common in the workplace, about ten years after it first started scaling in the 1990s. But there are also growing mutterings that AI is a very lucrative bubble that is about to burst. Mr Nadella conceded that ""all tech things are about booms and busts and bubbles"" and warned that AI should not be ""over-hyped or under-hyped"". He acknowledged that its energy consumption remains ""very high"" but argued that its potential benefits, especially in the fields of healthcare, public services, and business productivity, were worthwhile. Meanwhile, when asked about the massive energy resources required to power AI, Mr Huang said solar power would contribute, and he was hoping for more gas turbines in the short term that could be put ""off the grid so we don't burden people on the grid"". He added that AI itself would design better gas turbines, solar panels, wind turbines and fusion energy to produce more cost-effective sustainable energy. The campaign group Foxglove has warned that the UK could end up ""footing the bill for the colossal amounts of power the giants need"". The supercomputer, to be built in Loughton, Essex, was already announced by the government in January, but Microsoft has now come on board to the project. Big tech comes to town Mr Nadella was speaking exclusively to BBC News as Donald Trump arrived in the UK on a three-day state visit. The Tech Prosperity Deal between the two countries seeks to strengthen ties on AI, quantum computing and nuclear power. Questions have been asked about what if anything the UK has agreed to give in return. Technology Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC the deal did not include guarantees over scrapping a tax for big tech or on copyright for AI companies. The Digital Services Tax - a 2% levy which raises about £800m a year mainly from US tech companies - was previously said to be part of trade discussions. But Ms Kendall told the Today programme ""that wasn't part of the partnership"" now agreed. She also said no guarantees were made to AI companies on copyright, a major issue for the UK's creative sector - which has expressed concerns its work is being used by AI companies without permission. Meanwhile, a number of other tech companies have pledged billions of pounds in investment alongside Microsoft and Nvidia. Google has promised £5bn for AI research and infrastructure over the next two years. Tech leaders including Nadella, Huang and OpenAI boss Sam Altman will accompany Trump to a state banquet hosted by the Royal Family at Windsor Castle on Wednesday evening. AI growth zone in north-east England The government also said there was ""potential for more than 5,000 jobs and billions in private investment"" in north-east England, which has been designated as a new ""AI growth zone"". It has announced a data centre project at Cobalt Park, Northumberland - dubbed Stargate UK - from OpenAI, Nvidia, Nscale and semiconductor company Arm. However the UK version is much smaller than OpenAI's US-based Stargate project, launched in January with a commitment to invest $500bn (£367bn) over the next four years building new AI infrastructure. The Tony Blair Institute described the news as a ""breakthrough moment"" but added Britain had some work to do. Dr Keegan McBride, an emerging tech and geopolitics expert at the institute, said that work included ""reforming planning rules, accelerating the delivery of clean energy projects, and building the necessary digital infrastructure"" for growth. The Conservative Party highlighted that other big international companies such as the pharmaceutical giant Merck have recently cancelled or delayed their UK expansion plans.","US tech giants, including Microsoft ($30 billion investment), Google (£5 billion), and Nvidia, have pledged tens of billions of pounds in investment to the UK as part of a £31 billion ""Tech Prosperity Deal.""  This deal, announced alongside President Trump's state visit, aims to establish the UK as a global AI superpower.  Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang declared the UK's potential to achieve this within the next five years, contingent on building the necessary AI infrastructure, which his company is actively contributing to.  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella echoed this sentiment, emphasizing AI's potential to boost UK economic growth.  The investment will fund projects like a new supercomputer in Essex and a data center in Northumberland, creating thousands of high-skilled jobs.  While the deal promises significant economic benefits, concerns remain about the UK's concessions in return, the massive energy consumption of AI, and potential risks associated with the technology's rapid development.  The UK government highlights the deal's positive impact, but some question its long-term sustainability and the potential for a speculative bubble to burst.

For example, the huge 70,000 hectare (173,000 acre) White Wells sheep farm in Australia is now the Charles Darwin Reserve, home to 700 species of plant and 230 animals. Another 70,000 hectare (173,000 acre) area in Argentina, previously the Chacabuco sheep ranch, is now a nature reserve and home to the rhea or ñandú, an uncommon bird related to ostriches and emus. There are many similar examples worldwide. While the use of synthetic alternatives has taken pressure off land, they have come with other issues, particularly plastic pollution and an increased reliance on fossil fuels. There are solutions to these new problems however, such as landless biodegradable bio-plastics based on fungal mycelium or microbial processes, and they are beginning to scale up. Further, while agricultural land use has declined, not all of it has been replaced by natural forests; there has been a huge growth in plantation forestry for timber products worldwide, and plantation forests generally harbour much less biodiversity than natural forests. Overall, the steady slowdown in agricultural land use is welcome. However, it's not guaranteed to continue, nor is it fast enough to bring about the land use change we need to achieve our global climate or biodiversity goals. To keep global temperature rise below 2C, we will need to tap the huge potential of our natural ecosystems to suck carbon out of the atmosphere. What will happen in the future? We think current trends are likely to continue, with more and more land previously used for agriculture being freed up across the world. But this process could also accelerate further due to a range of promising technologies and solutions which could produce transformational change to our food systems, reducing land used for food production even more. Some of these are close to being a commercial reality; others are still just ideas in research labs. What we can expect Based on historical trends and future forecasts, it is likely that crop yields will continue to increase globally on average. In 1961, we produced just over one tonne of grain per hectare (0.4 tonnes per acre). We now produce over four tonnes per hectare (1.6 tonnes per acre).","Global agricultural land use is shrinking, marking a significant shift in land management.  The decline, exemplified by the 50% reduction in wool production since 1990, has resulted in the restoration of some former grazing lands to natural habitats, like the transformation of Australian and Argentinian sheep farms into biodiversity reserves. While synthetic alternatives have lessened pressure on land, they raise concerns about plastic pollution and fossil fuel reliance.  Although the U.S. Department of Agriculture welcomes this slowdown, they caution it's insufficient to meet climate and biodiversity goals.  Increased crop yields offer hope, with production quadrupling since 1961, but the future impact of emerging technologies on land use remains uncertain.  Continued agricultural land reduction is anticipated, potentially accelerated by technological advancements in food production.
","वैश्विक कृषि भूमि उपयोग में कमी आ रही है, जो भूमि प्रबंधन में एक महत्वपूर्ण बदलाव को दर्शाता है।  इस गिरावट का उदाहरण 1990 के बाद से ऊन उत्पादन में 50% की कमी से मिलता है, जिसके परिणामस्वरूप कुछ पूर्व चरागाह भूमि का प्राकृतिक आवासों में पुनर्स्थापन हुआ है, जैसे कि ऑस्ट्रेलियाई और अर्जेंटीनी भेड़ के खेतों का जैव विविधता भंडार में परिवर्तन। जबकि सिंथेटिक विकल्पों ने भूमि पर दबाव को कम किया है, वे प्लास्टिक प्रदूषण और जीवाश्म ईंधन पर निर्भरता के बारे में चिंताएँ पैदा करते हैं। हालाँकि अमेरिकी कृषि विभाग इस मंदी का स्वागत करता है, वे सावधानी बरतते हुए कहते हैं कि यह जलवायु और जैव विविधता के लक्ष्यों को पूरा करने के लिए अपर्याप्त है।  बढ़ी हुई फसल उत्पादकता आशा प्रदान करती है, 1961 के बाद से उत्पादन चौगुना हो गया है, लेकिन भविष्य में उभरती प्रौद्योगिकियों का भूमि उपयोग पर प्रभाव अनिश्चित बना हुआ है। कृषि भूमि में कमी जारी रहने की उम्मीद है, संभावित रूप से खाद्य उत्पादन में तकनीकी प्रगति से इसे और तेज़ किया जा सकता है।

In a statement to the American Civil Liberties Union, Mr Khalil said: ""It is no surprise that the Trump administration continues to retaliate against me for my exercise of free speech."" Judge Jamee Comans, based in Louisiana, said Mr Khalil ""wilfully misrepresented material fact(s) for the sole purpose of circumventing the immigration process"". An immigration judge in the US has ordered the deportation of pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil to either Algeria or Syria, over claims he omitted information from a green card application. Lawyers for Mr Khalil, 30, said they would appeal against the decision, and added that separate federal court orders remained in effect that prohibit the government from deporting or detaining him. In March, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials detained Mr Khalil as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on universities it claims have failed to tackle antisemitism. Mr Khalil, born in Syria and a citizen of Algeria, was held in an immigration facility in Louisiana for three months before a federal judge ruled that he was neither a flight risk nor a threat to his community. On 20 June, the judge ruled Mr Khalil must be released. While detained, Mr Khalil's wife, a US citizen, gave birth to their son. In March, the US government also accused Mr Khalil of leaving out details of his previous associations on immigration documentation, including membership of Unwra - the UN agency that works with Palestinians - and ""continuing employment"" at the British Embassy in Beirut. Responding to the recent decision, Mr Khalil added: ""When their first effort to deport me was set to fail, they resorted to fabricating baseless and ridiculous allegations in a bid to silence me for speaking out and standing firmly with Palestine, demanding an end to the ongoing genocide."" In June, Mr Khalil's lawyers filed a claim for $20m (£14.7m) in damages alleging false imprisonment, malicious prosecution and being smeared as an antisemite. Trump has repeatedly alleged that pro-Palestinian activists, including Mr Khalil, support Hamas, a group designated a terrorist organisation by the US. The president argues these protesters should be deported and called Mr Khalil's arrest ""the first of many to come"". Mr Khalil's role in Columbia's 2024 protests placed him in the public eye. On the front lines of negotiations, he played a role in mediating between university officials and the activists and students who attended the protests. Activists supporting Israel have accused Mr Khalil of being a leader of Columbia University Apartheid Divest (Cuad), a student group that demanded, among other things, the university to divest from its financial ties to Israel and a ceasefire in Gaza. Mr Khalil has denied that he led the group, telling the Associated Press (AP) that he only served as a spokesperson for protesters and as a mediator with the university.","Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and Columbia University student, has been ordered deported to Algeria or Syria for allegedly misrepresenting facts in his green card application. He and his lawyers claim the move is political retaliation for his pro-Palestinian activism during the 2024 Gaza protests and plan to appeal. Khalil was earlier detained but later released, filed a $20m lawsuit against the US government, and denies accusations of hiding past affiliations. While Trump accuses him of supporting Hamas, Khalil maintains he only acted as a spokesperson and mediator in the protests.","महमूद खलील, एक फ़िलिस्तीनी कार्यकर्ता और कोलंबिया यूनिवर्सिटी के छात्र, को ग्रीन कार्ड आवेदन में तथ्यों की गलत जानकारी देने के आरोप में अल्जीरिया या सीरिया निर्वासित करने का आदेश दिया गया है। खलील और उनके वकील इसे 2024 गाज़ा प्रदर्शनों में उनकी pro-Palestinian गतिविधियों के लिए राजनीतिक बदले की कार्रवाई बताते हैं और अपील करने की योजना बना रहे हैं। उन्हें पहले हिरासत में लिया गया था लेकिन बाद में रिहा किया गया। उन्होंने अमेरिकी सरकार के खिलाफ 20 मिलियन डॉलर का मुकदमा दायर किया है और छिपे हुए संबंधों के आरोपों से इनकार किया है। ट्रम्प ने उन पर हमास का समर्थन करने का आरोप लगाया, जबकि खलील का कहना है कि वह केवल प्रवक्ता और मध्यस्थ की भूमिका में थे।",en,[],,An immigration judge ordered Khalil be deported to Algeria or Syria over claims he omitted information on a green card application.,[''],www.bbc.com_future-planet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wages for many have risen at a faster pace than inflation - but even for those people, they are frustrated that their money is stretching a bit less further than hoped. It’s particularly painful for those on lower incomes, as the resurgence of inflation has been rooted in staple products. There’s anxiety too for homeowners or landlords, who hope that interest rate cuts later this year may be looming. But much of the recent rise in inflation has been spurred by global commodity prices - energy and food - and many of those pressures are subsiding. One factor that has led to food inflation outstripping rates in Europe is government policy. The Bank of England are among economists who’ve suggested that measures such as higher National Insurance Contributions and minimum wages may have added more than 1% to food prices, while adding to cost pressures elsewhere. Those too should pass - but could there be more? The boss of Aldi has warned that more price rises may loom, depending on Budget measures. The government says the Budget will help to ease the cost of living pressures on consumers and businesses - we will have to wait to see exactly what that means. We're ending our live coverage of today's inflation news but you can read our full report here.","Despite wages outpacing inflation, many UK households, particularly those with low incomes, continue to struggle as food and energy prices remain high.

From Plato to Foucault, a Banksy expert reveals the philosophy behind these popular artworks. Which is the real you, the person you are now or the one you are capable of becoming? It's a heady question, to be sure, and not one you would expect to be confronted with while strolling down a street in Marseille in the waning days of May. Yet it's precisely the existential dilemma that Banksy, who once asserted ""being yourself is overrated"" – has surreptitiously installed in a cloistered stretch of the quiet Rue Félix Fregier, the site of a new work – the latest installment in the elusive artist's decades-long career as a provocative philosophical prankster. For more than 30 years, Banksy has spiked many of his most iconic works – from his girl reaching hopelessly for a heart-shaped balloon to his masked rioter hurling a bouquet of flowers – with barbed allusions to Old Masters, from Michelangelo to Monet, Vermeer to Van Gogh. But there's more. Beneath his stealthy stencils lies a deep and deliberate engagement with the history of ideas as well, from classical Stoicism to postmodern deconstructionism. On 29 May, Banksy posted on Instagram a photo of his first new piece in more than five months, piquing the internet's interest by withholding its precise location. Discovered shortly thereafter in the major port city in southern France, Marseille, the mural is, at first glance, deceptively simple: a tall silhouette of a lighthouse spray-painted on to a blank beige urban wall; a rusting street bollard positioned nearby; and a painted shadow stretching across the pavement, joining the real-world object to its augmented, if two-dimensional, echo. Stencilled across the black lighthouse are the words: ""I want to be what you saw in me."" Anyone keen to find a source for the ideas that inform Banksy's new work needs merely to flip open any history of philosophy to Plato's seminal allegory of the cave (from the Fourth-Century BC treatise The Republic), then flip the ancient metaphor on its head. In Plato's parable, prisoners chained inside a cave mistake shadows on the wall for reality, unaware of the truer forms that cast them outside. But here, Banksy, being Banksy, baits us by switching the set-up, reversing the relationship between essence and shadow. In Banksy's mural, the drab bollard casts not a diminished imitation of itself, but something far grander – a lighthouse, a symbol of illumination and guidance. Here, it's the silhouette, not reality, that's true. Banksy's inversion urges us to ask where reality really resides: in what is, or in what might be? His poignant phrase – ""I want to be what you saw in me"" – is alluringly elastic. Is this the bollard dreaming of being more than it appears? Or the shadow wishing to become light? Or is it all of us – Banksy included – struggling to live up to the better versions imagined by those who believe in us? The answer is surely yes to all of the above. And it's a yes too to the question: 'is this new work a lamp capable of shining light on further levels of meaning in Banksy?' What follows is a brief look back at some of the artist's best-known works and how they too are invigorated by, and often upend, many of the most important philosophical tenets – both social and intellectual – that underwrite who we are and who we might be. Girl with Balloon, 2002","Banksy’s new Marseille mural transforms a simple bollard into the shadow of a lighthouse, inscribed with “I want to be what you saw in me.” Drawing on Plato’s cave allegory, it inverts the essence-shadow relationship to explore identity, aspiration, and perception. Like his earlier works, it fuses art and philosophy, urging viewers to question reality and strive for their better selves.","बैंक्सी की नई मार्सेई भित्ति-चित्र में एक साधारण बोलार्ड की परछाई को प्रकाशस्तंभ में बदलते हुए दिखाया गया है, जिस पर लिखा है – ""मैं वही बनना चाहता हूँ जो तुमने मुझमें देखा।"" प्लेटो की गुफा की उपमा से प्रेरित यह कृति वास्तविकता और परछाई के संबंध को उलट देती है और पहचान, आकांक्षा व दृष्टिकोण पर विचार करने को प्रेरित करती है। अपनी पूर्व रचनाओं की तरह ही, यह कला और दर्शन का संगम है, जो दर्शकों को अपनी वास्तविकता और बेहतर रूप की खोज पर सोचने को मजबूर करता है।",en,[],,Banksy's new mural in Marseille is not the first image he has connected to the history of ideas.

Townsend had a day earlier taken to Instagram to share her reaction to some of the food she saw being served at a restaurant, including dishes like braised soft-shell turtle with fish maw and dry pot bullfrog.

They say this is evidence humans may have got our taste for alcohol from common primate ancestors who relied on fermented fruit - a source of sugar and alcohol - for food. ""Human attraction to alcohol probably arose from this dietary heritage of our common ancestor with chimpanzees,"" said study researcher Aleksey Maro of the University of California, Berkeley. Chimps, like many other animals, have been spotted feeding on ripe fruit lying on the forest floor, but this is the first study to make clear how much alcohol they might be consuming. The research team measured the amount of ethanol, or pure alcohol, in fruits such as figs and plums eaten in large quantities by wild chimps in Côte d'Ivoire and Uganda. Based on the amount of fruit they normally eat, the chimps were ingesting around 14 grams of ethanol - equivalent to nearly two UK units, or roughly one 330ml bottle of lager. The fruits most commonly eaten were those highest in alcohol content. Aleksey Maro Figs are a significant part of the diet for many primates, including chimpanzees The research adds weight to the so-called ""drunken monkey"" hypothesis - the idea that the human appetite for alcohol was inherited from our primate ancestors. This was first proposed by Prof Robert Dudley of the University of California, Berkeley, who is a co-researcher on the study. Scientists were initially sceptical. But more observations of ""scrumping apes"" have emerged in recent years, said Prof Catherine Hobaiter, a primatologist at the University of St Andrews, who was not part of the research team. ""What we're realising from this work is that our relationship with alcohol goes deep back into evolutionary time, probably about 30 million years,"" she told BBC News.
